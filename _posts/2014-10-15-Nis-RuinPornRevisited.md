In one of my earliest posts I wrote about the concept of ruin porn, and the negative impact it has on its subjects. From a throne of non-conformity I vowed to negate stereotypes and show the cities of the world in an accurate and ultimately flattering light.  I did not have the foresight however, to brainstorm how I would approach coverage of places that do in fact look very much like one would expect them to.

The city of Niš, Serbia appears as if it were built about 50 feet above the ground and dropped into place, the collision with Earth causing its buildings to crack and crumble, chunks of concrete chipping away to reveal the raw brick foundations beneath. One might conclude that in the wake of the crash a cloud of dust settled, clinging to every surface and leaving a layer of crud atop, or maybe stripping away, any glossy finish that previously existed.  The result is a city that resembles a 1970s kitchen appliance - once top of the line, perhaps - but now its muted hues of green, orange, and yellow have been worked far beyond their life expectancy. Picture Serbia, and that is what Niš looks like.

So what is an aspiring optimist to do when a city fits this bill? One option is to focus only on the people, but such a route usually ends up either patronizing or further exoticizing the population.  This method also ignores the fact that people are at once different and exactly the same everywhere; meaning that a week's worth of ethnography would be inaccurate to say the least.

Another option would be to admit that there are places on Earth that coincide perfectly with what the west thinks of them.  But I just don't think this is true. If it were, why have I taken such a liking to Niš? Why did I extend my initial three-night stay to six? Why here, more than anywhere else before it, have I pushed the limits of my language skills in interactions with strangers? These things seem out of place in the Serbia I knew before I went there. No, this method won't do either.

The best I can come up with is that there is something in the feel of the city that elevates it far above its ruin-porn-inspiring appearance. I'm not quite sure where the feel of a city comes from, but I do know that walking alongside graffiti covered housing blocks or encountering the occasional scrap-metal shack does not feel dangerous or uncomfortable here like it would in the United States.  I hate to admit it, but I suspect that some of my preconceived notions, which suggest that this is what Serbia is supposed to look like, have contributed to the lack of uncertainty that I feel here.  Could it be that my experience has actually benefitted from a stereotype? I'll hold off on answering definitively for now, as that is a statement I am not prepared to make. In the meantime, here are a few photos of the city's somewhat motley appearance, to be viewed under the caveat that they do not say much about what it feels like to be there.
