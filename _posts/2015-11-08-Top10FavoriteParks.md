Lonely Planet recently released their annual “Best in Travel” rankings and I couldn’t help but feel inspired.  I tend to shy away from making lists like this, especially ones with the word “best” in the title, but given the subject matter felt the format would be fitting.  Due to their subjective nature, lists simply beg for disagreement; even more so when you throw skateboarding into the mix.  When you combine skateboarding and traveling, there are countless immeasurable characteristics that can have an effect on one’s impression of a place, and therefore I’ve chosen to focus on my top ten *favorite* skateparks from my recent travels rather than try to rank the *best*.

#1. Tseung Kwon O - Hong Kong

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/22181169091/in/dateposted-public/" title="2015-03-12 17.41.30"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5654/22181169091_64c4724a7e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2015-03-12 17.41.30"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After all that explaining, the park at the top of my list is indeed the one that most would call the “best”.  Unfortunately, I only got to skate TKO for a total of about 30 minutes before I slipped in a puddle and jammed my toe, which still hurts as I write this seven months later.  However, that half hour was all it took to convince me that this park was a cut above those that I had skated in the seven months prior.  Flawless transition, smooth coping, and lines as far as the eye can see.  Simply the best.

#2. East Coast Park - Singapore

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/21549865503/in/dateposted-public/" title="2015-01-05 17.17.23"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/624/21549865503_f96f25b085_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2015-01-05 17.17.23"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I would be hard pressed to fly to the other side of the globe just to go to Singapore. The wealthy, famously regulated city state, positioned at the very tip of the Malaysian peninsula, is (for an American) similar to visiting Canada: You know you’re in a different country, but it requires very little effort to be there. I understand that this may be a selling point for some people, but an equal many may find themselves underwhelmed. Even so, East Coast Park is at the top of the list of things that have the potential to lure me back.  Like everywhere else in the country, the park is in immaculate condition, and has a decent spread of features to satisfy all sorts of skaters. It’s well lit too, which is a huge plus when dealing with the climate of a country that sits just north of the equator.

#3. SMP - Shanghai, China

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/22158288762/in/dateposted-public/" title="2015-03-31 10.37.37"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5673/22158288762_f604237ac0_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2015-03-31 10.37.37"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I once cited SMP as the “most dangerous skatepark on Earth”.  I still think this is true. Decaying 15 foot deep ends and 20 foot full pipes aside, the park has a lot of other fun stuff that is less likely to result in a trip to a Chinese emergency room. Unless you’re amongst the top 1% of skateboarders, don’t expect a whole lot from most of the bowls, but thankfully the smaller features are available in large quantities and varieties.

#4. Shah Alam Extreme Park - Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/21549867583/in/dateposted-public/" title="2014-12-22 14.56.58"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5765/21549867583_8c418d2ecd_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2014-12-22 14.56.58"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Shah Alam was one of the parks that I was most excited about before leaving for my trip, and it did not disappoint.  From what I can tell it’s one of the oldest in the area, but in spite of some rough spots and a few wacky transitions, it offers a lot of variety and has a decent flow.  It’s a little bit of a hike from downtown KL, but if you’re lucky like me, you can meet a local who is stoked to show you around and make sure cab drivers don’t rip you off.

#5. Nangang Skatepark - Taipei, Taiwan

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/21984049699/in/dateposted-public/" title="2015-02-11 13.20.45"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5795/21984049699_6e7ac158cf_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2015-02-11 13.20.45"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Most skateboarders who visit Taiwan would argue that a skatepark in Taipei is irrelevant.  I can see their logic. The entire city is a skatepark even if you don’t fancy yourself a “street” skater.  That said, the bowl and vert ramp just outside the Nangang MRT station are really, really fun.  There used to be an actual skatepark to accompany the ramps, but it is in the process of being rebuilt, and completion dates are fuzzy.  It seems likely that the remaining ramps are slated for renovation as well, so my advice would be to get there soon, lest they disappear before you get a chance to skate them.

#6. Putrajaya Challenge Park - Putrajaya, Malaysia

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/22158293202/in/dateposted-public/" title="2014-12-20 12.41.06"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5822/22158293202_fa3db76ebb_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2014-12-20 12.41.06"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I probably don’t need to explain why this one is on the list, just look at the pictures. It takes forever to get to from Kuala Lumpur (ok, like an hour by public transport), but once you’re there you could skate all day without repeating the same line.  The weather didn’t allow this for me, but hanging out beneath an overhang hoping the downpours would stop allowed me to meet a bunch of local skaters who were incredibly welcoming.

#7. Sofia, Bulgaria

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/22170909615/in/dateposted-public/" title="MegaRamp2"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5683/22170909615_9c47f118e7_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="MegaRamp2"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I can’t say for sure, but Sofia might be home to the world’s only public mega-ramp.  Though on a smaller scale than the behemoth kickers now serving as jungle gyms for 10 year old prodigies, the mega-ramp at the Sofia skatepark still signifies some questionable decision making. Aside from the apparent lack of concern for public safety, the park has a degree of flow uncharacteristic of most in the Balkans, and if you can dodge the cracks between the slabs of concrete on which it stands, there are some good lines to be found.

#8. George Town - Malaysia

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/22170913025/in/dateposted-public/" title="2015-01-01 13.26.03"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5772/22170913025_5ee4cbec4f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2015-01-01 13.26.03"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

George Town’s presence on this list requires a bit of explanation.  Though a picture may be worth a thousand words, in this case none of those words justify why the park is worth going to.  Allow me to paint a picture. The park sits on the outskirts of the city and is surrounded by jungle.  In my entire time there, I never once saw it completely dry, despite sunny weather and temperatures near 100 degrees.  Monkeys line the decks of the quarterpipes, but pay little attention to skaters aside from scouting out unguarded personal items.  On one afternoon, I nearly ran over a panicking 4 foot long monitor lizard after looping out on one of the rails.  So, while the park is not technically very good, the presence of a few fun features in such an exotic location is more than ample reason why it should be on this list.

#9. Belgrade - Serbia

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/21984054209/in/dateposted-public/" title="2014-10-09 15.17.48"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/766/21984054209_e77836e852_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2014-10-09 15.17.48"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Going to skateparks in the Balkans is a good practice in traveling with an open mind.  To my knowledge, Grindline has never done any work there, and most of the parks more closely resemble something from the X-Games ten years ago than they do the average local park in the US northwest.  From a design standpoint, they are not on par with the parks being built in other parts of the world today.  The sooner you get this through your head, the better.  However, as far as Balkan skateparks go, Belgrade’s is amongst the finest.  You may scoff at the flybox and somewhat unreasonably large wallride, but if you go in with the intent of having fun, you’ll be trying to make it bank to bank before you know it.

#10.  Skopje - Macedonia

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/21983125478/in/dateposted-public/" title="Rail2"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5739/21983125478_8137e7899e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Rail2"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You may recall my post last fall in which I really laid into the bizarre concrete skateparks found throughout the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  Though I’m still a little confused, my post may not have been my finest exercise in good taste. I probably should have spent less time making fun of the bad parks and more time complimenting the pretty fun, new park just a short skate from Skopje’s city center.  A line of two pyramids with ledges and rails extends the mold of the typical back and forth park, and if you’re feeling adventurous, the adjacent bike path eventually leads to some DIY features and another, less savory park.
