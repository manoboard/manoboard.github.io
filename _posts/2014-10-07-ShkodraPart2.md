I awoke to my phone's alarm at 7:30 on the morning of October 4, packed my things and headed out in order to catch a 9 o'clock bus back to Ulcinj. From there I would take a local bus to my next destination, the port city of Bar, Montenegro.  I went into the restaurant area of the hotel, where the family who ran the place was usually stationed, to settle up on my bill.  The transaction was facilitated by one of the family's sons, who translated for his father, a tall, dark-featured, Albanian man dressed in a grey suit.  The price was a bit higher than I had anticipated, and I'm certain my face showed it.  Because I was not entirely sure of the exchange rate, I conceded that it was no use haggling and that I was still within my budget, so I accepted the sudden increase in fare.  I left the hotel disheartened, all the good things I had thought about Albania's kind and helpful people nearly erased from my mind.  It is amazing how one negative interaction can completely change one's perception of a place.  I scowled all the way to the city center, where I planned to double check the bus schedule at the tourist information office, but found it closed. 

Strike two, Albania.

Despite being the second largest city in the country, Shkodra does not have an actual bus station. Instead, there is an area marked with a small sign where buses pick up passengers.  There is no advance-purchase of tickets, the fee is simply paid to the driver.  This system works relatively well for those who know the schedule by heart. For me, I was left to hope that I was in the correct location for a bus to save me from this godforsaken land.

So I waited.

Around 8:40 a man who I would guess was in his early 50s approached me, jingling his car keys, asking if I needed a taxi.  I assured him that no, I would be taking the bus, at which he responded "autobus, no, no" and proceeded to say a whole bunch of other things in Albanian that I did not care to understand.  Because it was not yet 9 o'clock, I concluded that this guy was looking to charge an unsuspecting tourist an exorbitant fee for a ride they did not require.

Not on my watch, pal.

Around 8:50, three more men, all about the same age as the first guy, approached me offering the same service.  

"Very small price, 25 euro," one insisted.

I informed them too, that I would be taking the autobus, thank you very much, to which I received the same reply.  This time however, I recognized another word in their explanation: "Muslim." As they motioned to the mosque across the street from where we were standing, I thought I recalled a fact (which I would later find out was incorrect) that the Islamic day of prayer is Saturday. They were trying to tell me that because it was the sabbath, the buses were not running.  Once again, I thought I had them beat.  After all, I had been traveling for 7 weeks in places with large Muslim populations and had never encountered this issue.  

They walked away with an air of "it's your funeral," and as the clock struck nine I began to feel like an idiot.  Not only was there no bus in sight, but I was the only one standing at the bus stop.  I motioned to the first man who had attempted to swoon me with his offer of a taxi, and he shot me a grin that said "oh the bus didn't come, huh?" I crossed the street to meet him. The tables had turned; he was no longer catering to me, but I to him.  Attempting to keep the ball in my court, I asked how much it would cost for a ride to Ulcinj. He typed the number "25" into his phone, and turned it to show me.  

"Alright", I thought to myself.  "That's the same price the other guys quoted me. I'm not getting ripped off."

After negotiating the price in the local currency, I went to the ATM and withdrew the 3000 Leke that I needed to pay the driver.  As he led me to his car, we were met by one of the other men who had offered me a ride. I quickly realized that the man with whom I had just negotiated the cost of the trip was not the driver at all, but simply a middle man for the others who had approached me.  

"They're all in this together", I thought. My heart sank.  

Despite my brain's objections, my body stepped into the front seat of the car; a brand new, jet black, Mercedes-Benz sedan, which coincidentally showed no signs of being an officially designated cab.  Having already paid and put my large backpack in the trunk, I figured I was in this for the long haul. The best I could hope for now was to make it to my destination in one piece. As I mulled over my poor decision, a short woman in a sweatsuit, probably in her 50s or 60s, climbed into the back seat of the car.

"Of course", I thought. "Why scam one person when you could scam two?" The woman, who was Albanian, seemed to think nothing of the situation at hand. She became my beacon of hope.

We pulled away from the curb and into the automotive free-for-all, making our way out of the city.  If there is one stereotype that I have found no argument against during my time in the region, it is that Eastern European drivers have a death wish.  The taxi driver put the previous trip's bus driver to shame with his antics. He used the horn as a warning to other cars, cyclists, and pedestrians, letting them know he was coming and that they had better get out of the way.  At one point we passed a speed limit sign which read "30", and I snuck a glance at the speedometer. We were going "90". 

The driver looked over to me, taking his eyes off the road that he was so dangerously navigating and asked, "Deutsch? UK?" Understanding that he wanted to know where I was from, the thought crossed my mind to answer "Canada", but I quickly realized that he would be seeing my passport in a matter of minutes, at which point I'd be exposed.  

"American" I admitted.  His eyes lit up.

"Ohhhhh AMERICAN! Very good!" 

He gave me a thumbs up, which I interpreted as "Your head will fetch a pretty price!"

He kept his reckless pace all the way to the border, where we joined the line of stopped traffic hoping to cross into Montenegro. The driver turned off the engine and stepped out of the car.  He strolled over to another group of men, presumably his mafioso peers, to shoot the breeze while we waited.  I unbuckled my seatbelt attempting to appear unfazed by the events that seemed to be unfolding before me.  The woman in the back seat stepped out for a cigarette.

After about 20 minutes of sitting still, the traffic ahead of us began to move.  I gazed over to where my escort had been standing, and found him in heated conversation with one of the border guards.  I watched as he gestured wildly to the man in uniform, who appeared unamused. Meanwhile the gap between the car in front of us and our vehicle grew, and the traffic behind us started honking.  My driver seemed not to notice, until one of the cars behind us sped around our vehicle and back into the queue.  This caught the attention of my driver, who shook hands with the border guard and refocused his wild gestures and strong words toward the car that had just passed us.  He repositioned himself in the driver's seat and weaved around his foe, attempting to regain our lost ground.  Of course, at this point traffic had stopped again, and we found ourselves neck and neck with the other vehicle.  The passenger-side window lowered, and I sat in the crossfire as the two men shot burst of Albanian language back and forth. Traffic began to move, and we squeezed in front of the other car.  None of what was going on seemed to have any impact on the border guards, who checked their phones and chatted amongst one another.

Once through the border, I began to ease up.  I was nearly back to a city that had seemed otherworldly to me just two days before, but now felt like home. I also felt safer in that the driver had put on his seatbelt, and was keeping our speed at roughly 1.5 to 2 times the posted limit.

When I negotiated the ride in Shkodra, I asked to be dropped off at the bus station in Ulcinj, which hinted that this was not my final destination.  This was true, but I was not prepared to risk spending any more time than necessary in that cab.  The driver turned to me as he had before, and inquired as to where I was going after we reached Ulcinj, to which I replied that someone from my hotel was picking me up there. Not only did this safeguard me from further extortion, but also let him know that somebody was expecting me, and would be suspicious if I did not turn up.  The ease with which one can fabricate lies when they feel endangered is miraculous.

He nodded and turned his attention back to the road.  Crisis averted.

We pulled into Ulcinj, and stopped in front of a supermarket to let the woman in the back seat out.  We were only a mile or so from the bus station, so if I was going be robbed, killed, or some combination of the two, it would be now, while the driver had me alone in the vehicle. Instead, we continued to the bus station, where he hoisted my pack out of the trunk and helped me get it on my back, shook my hand and said goodbye. With a smile, he stepped back into the driver's seat and pulled away. 

A wave of relief came over me.  I waltzed into the bus station with a spring in my step and a new lease on life.

A couple hours later, I was sitting in a restaurant in Bar, prepared to treat myself to some lunch and a beer or two after such a stressful morning.  When I asked the waiter for a Nicksicko, he responded simply, "no Nicksicko". Assuming he meant they were out of the local brew, I quickly scanned the beer list and asked for a Bavaria instead.  

"No, no alcohol", he explained.  Finding this a bit strange, considering I was holding a beer menu, I settled for a Coke.

As the waiter walked toward the kitchen it hit me.  The taxi peddlers in Shkoder had said something about Muslims, and now this restaurant was not serving alcohol.  I ate my lunch and quickly returned to my room, where I immediately took to the internet.  My suspicions were confirmed; this day, October 4, 2014 was Eid al-Adha, an important Muslim holiday.  That's what the men in Shkodra were trying to tell me. Additionally, there was an email in my inbox from the hotel, apologizing profusely for accidentally charging me for an extra night, and offering a number of ways to rectify their mistake. For the second time in less than 12 hours, I was reminded that I might not be as savvy a world traveler as I would sometimes like to believe.  Twice that day I had let my preconceived notions of a place I knew next to nothing about impact the interactions I had with its people - who as it turns out, were not trying to screw me.

Most important among the lessons I learned through this experience is that while it is smart to remain on one's guard while traveling, it is also necessary to be realistic. Despite what we are told time and time again, people often do have genuine intentions.  I had nearly let two misunderstandings ruin my perception of a city where I had encountered nothing but kindness and hospitality.  I was prepared to return home and inform all my friends that Albania is all it is cracked up to be, when in reality it is the opposite.  I now feel that I know less about the country than I did before I visited, but as I concluded the night before my wild ride, I am certainly glad I went.
