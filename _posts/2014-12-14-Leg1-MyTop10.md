title: Leg 1 - My Top 10

---

Making a "best of" list is risky business, so I'll start with a disclaimer. Of the 22 locations I visited during the first four months of my trip, there is not a single one that I wouldn't go back to given the opportunity. Additionally, a lot of factors such as weather, accommodations, and interactions with locals - that could be completely different in future visits - played a major role in my experiences and ultimate decisions. What I'm trying to say here is that this list is very flexible. I considered not using a number system, but what fun is an unranked list? And, after all, there were some places that I did especially enjoy, and I believe they warrant special recognition. Anyway, now that I've sufficiently safeguarded myself from criticism, I present to you my top ten favorite places from the first four months of my trip.

## 1. Tie: Sofia, Bulgaria and Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina 

With an introduction like that, it's no surprise that I couldn't just pick one favorite place and stick to it. The reason I'm struggling to decide between Sofia and Sarajevo is partially because the two cities are so different. I also visited them at nearly opposite ends of the leg, during completely different seasons. Regardless, each city provided exactly what I was looking for at that moment in time, and equally deserve the number one spot on the list.

### Sofia

When people talk about Bulgaria's capital, their comments are often carried by undercurrents of indifference. "Yeah, Sofia is ok", or "It's nice", are usually the most enthusiastic responses mustered up in descriptions of the city. Additionally, people always make a point to note that Sofia is not a particularly beautiful place. I could not disagree more. I suspect that what underwhelms most travelers about their experience in the Bulgarian capital is precisely what made mine so splendid. At no point during my 11 day stay did I feel as if the city were trying to impress me.  Absent were the comments beginning with "you have to go to" or "you can't visit Sofia without". Likewise, there were no long lines or crowds of selfie-snapping tourists. Instead, I felt free to explore the city at my own pace, never once worrying if I was seeing the right things or going to the right places. This however, is not to say that there is nothing to see or do in Sofia. There are tons of museums, churches, stores, restaurants, and even a handful of decent places to skate, all of which were waiting for me when I wanted them, and never once forced upon me.

### Sarajevo
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/15391711433/" title="image by manoboard88, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8614/15391711433_c08c0c6e1e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="image"></a>

When I return to the Balkans, Sarajevo will most likely be my first stop, which is fitting considering it was my first stop on this trip. The reasons why Sarajevo sits atop this list are relatively obvious. The food is awesome, the people are friendly, the skatepark is fun (albeit in a state of disrepair), and despite being full of bullet holes and bombed out buildings, it remains one of the most beautiful cities I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. Sarajevo is an extremely easy city to spend time in, which is perfect for a man of leisure like myself. Many an afternoon was spent sitting in a park or along the river with a cheap mug (or can) of Sarajevsko in hand, biding my time and wondering how a city that was so brutally beaten down could be so full of life.

## 3. Belgrade, Serbia 
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/15825556257/" title="image by manoboard88, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7579/15825556257_09e8d2c19f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="image"></a>

I suppose it is only fitting that the city responsible for Sarajevo's brutal beating would also land itself in the my top three. I had every intention of hating Belgrade and its residents, but things obviously didn't quite go as planned. Like Sofia, Belgrade is rarely mentioned without comments about its drab appearance following close behind. At this point I'm beginning to think I have a different concept of what constitutes an "ugly" city than most people. Sure there are some communist era concrete blocks - plenty of them actually - but alongside those are beautifully constructed museums and administrative buildings surrounded by lush green public parks. The skatepark is pretty fun too, and the people who use it are friendly and welcoming - two words that that don't get enough use in descriptions of Serbs.

## 4. Skopje, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/15824029200/" title="image by manoboard88, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7571/15824029200_91811b2172_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="image"></a>

I had pretty low expectations going into Skopje. Whenever you hear anything about the city, it is in regards to the FYROM/Greek Macedonia name dispute, or the gargantuan and somewhat tacky makeover the city center is currently undergoing. I can't argue the latter; whoever designed the main drag may have had Rome in mind, but they ended up closer to Vegas. However, the gaudy marble statues and fountains are no match for all the other wonderful things the city has to offer. Of all the places I went, I found that great grilled food was the most readily available in Skopje. Someone with not a clue about where to eat could walk through the city center and find numerous places with extremely cheap, extremely delicious Cevapcici, pljeskavica, Shopska salad, and baked beans unlike any I've had elsewhere. 

## 5. Nis, Serbia 
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/16009346471/" title="image by manoboard88, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7537/16009346471_7bdd9cb402_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="image"></a>

While I had low expectations going into Skopje, I really had no expectations going into Nis. All I knew was that it was Serbia's third largest city, and that it contained within its boundaries a miniramp and a monument made out of human skulls. It was also on the way to Kosovo, so I figured I might as well stop. I immediately took a liking to the city, and my three day stay quickly turned to six. The city is easy to navigate and contains a lot of sights for its size. The skatepark was small, but fun, and the locals were eager to make friends. I also managed to order a couple meals entirely in Serbian, a feat of cultural proficiency that I am yet to repeat.

## 6. Plovdiv, Bulgaria 
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/15825537767/" title="image by manoboard88, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8565/15825537767_5510ba55e6_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="image"></a>

Coming at the end of my first leg, Plovdiv was the quiet and relaxing getaway that I needed before moving on to the string of notoriously overwhelming cities set to follow. Its quiet cobblestone streets could make a romantic out of even the most callous of hearts, and it's several hilltops, adorned with everything from Thracian and Romans ruins, to colossal Red Army Statues, tell the story of an ancient metropolis that has seen and endured it all.

## 7. Ulcinj, Montenegro
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/15823884448/" title="image by manoboard88, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7483/15823884448_f32295085a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="image"></a>

It is rumored that the sand on Ulcinj's Velika Plaza, or "Big Beach", contains mystical powers. I would certainly have to agree. On many occasions, I spent the afternoon gazing over the crystal clear water with a beer in my hand and not another soul in sight. Every so fifteen I found myself quoting Kurt Vonnegut aloud saying, "if this isn't nice, what is?" So magical are these fine grains of white sand that one Tuesday afternoon I found myself randomly compelled to take a dip au natural - something I have never done elsewhere.

## 8. Zabljak/Durmitor National Park, Montenegro
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/15824019310/" title="image by manoboard88, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7556/15824019310_2e2583ae54_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="image"></a>

If you saw the pictures from my earlier post about Durmitor National Park, it's no surprise that it made my top ten. The town of Zabljak is every bit the cosy mountain village one wants it to be, and feels remote both in location and time period. Conveniently, it is only a couple hours from the country's more popular destinations, and can be reached very easily by bus. There are even some ski lifts in the park, making me wonder if a winter excursion to Montenegro's northeast corner might be in order.

## 9. Cetinje, Montenegro
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/15825261299/" title="image by manoboard88, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7551/15825261299_84998a84fc_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="image"></a>

Cetinje is sort of a bizarre little town. I don't mean that in a bad way, though. It is bizarre in that it doesn't look or feel like anywhere else in Montenegro, or in the Balkans for that matter. The former presence of foreign embassies can still be felt despite the capital of the country being moved to Podgorica some years ago. Everything about the city felt international, from the architecture and the museums, right down to the Italian woman running my hotel.

## 10. Prishtina, Kosovo
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/16010585862/" title="image by manoboard88, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7470/16010585862_8e172406b3_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="image"></a>

Prishtina is perhaps the most difficult city on this list to describe in short terms. When one ventures outside the center, the poverty that most of prishtinas residents live in is strikingly apparent. When you speak to the people who have grown up there, their anger not only toward their former oppressors, but also at the current political climate, is quite clear. Perhaps it's this honesty that makes the city so appealing. One does not get the pomp and circumstance that more popular destinations provide, but instead they're greeted with open arms and treated like a friend instead of a customer.
