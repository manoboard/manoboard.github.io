Perhaps you've noticed, perhaps you haven't, but I've fallen slightly behind on blog posts. This, I assure you, is not out of laziness, nor is it out of lack of things to talk about. On the contrary, the past week and a half in Vietnam has been so stimulating that I've been unable to complete a post on any one subject. Every time I've begun to formulate one, I'm struck by a million other though provoking experiences before I have the chance to flesh out the one I had been working with. Maybe not a million, but you get the idea. Leading up to this entry, I began writing three separate posts on three entirely different subjects, but just can't seem to wrap any of them up properly without straying off onto some other line of thought. Until I can polish the pieces I've begun (which I will, I promise), I've resigned to simply posting some photos from my two day/one night cruise on Ha Long Bay, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site composed of 1,969 limestone islands of all different shapes and sizes. 

Interesting fact, there are more islands in the bay than are officially recognized, but the powers that be chose to draw the line at 1969 to commemorate the year of Ho Chi Minh's death. What an honor!
