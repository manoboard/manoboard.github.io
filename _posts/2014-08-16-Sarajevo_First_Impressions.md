I haven't been in Sarajevo long enough to make any profound statements about the city, but I have been here long enough to know that I'm going to enjoy my stay.  The scars of heavy artillery are apparent, but if the people of Sarajevo have war on their minds they certainly hide it well. Here is just a small sampling of what I've seen so far.

Bascarsija, the tourist center of Sarajevo.  This labyrinth of cobblestone alleyways could consume an entire trip to the city, I'm sure.

The Miljacka River and the Latin Bridge. I really doubt this guy was going to catch anything.

More of the Miljacka and surrounding area.  I just couldn't help myself!

In Seattle, teenagers live at the skatepark.  In Sarajevo, dogs do.

The Academy of Fine Arts had a cool free outdoor exhibit about peace (and war) and social justice (and injustice).

I'm saving inside for a rainy day.  For now, I'm doing a whole lot of exploring.  More photos and thoughts soon!
