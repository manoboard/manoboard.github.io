Twelve miles is rarely considered “walking distance.” However, as we set off on the Burke Gilman trail in Wallingford, Mikey and I could see no reason why we couldn’t simply walk to our final destination, Alki Beach.  For those unfamiliar with Seattle, Google maps clocks the distance at approximately 12 miles, but with no obligations and not a cloud in the sky, we figured “why not?”  

This was a bittersweet journey for me.  I said my goodbyes and left this morning to drive back east in preparation for my upcoming travels.  Though I’m eager to begin my adventure, I cannot help but feel a twinge of sadness in leaving the city I have come to love.  However, I can imagine no better swan song than to see Seattle as I saw it when I first moved there two years ago; on foot – and slowly.  

I am a huge advocate for long distance walking for the same reason I have wanted to travel to the Balkans for so long.  It’s a matter of freedom.  Just as people say “you can’t just go there” when you talk about Kosovo, the mention of walking more than a couple of miles to get somewhere elicits a similar “you can’t just do that” type of response.  In reality, there are few places on Earth that an American cannot simply go to if they feel so inclined, and likewise there is no limit to the number of miles a person can travel on foot. 

Walking, of course, is not the most efficient mode of transportation. Efficiency however, was not our goal.  We began west from Wallingford toward Fremont, where we stopped and skated a few curbs under the Fremont Bridge.  After we both felt satisfied, we crossed the bridge and carried on southward, eventually stopping for a quick skate in the shadow of the Space Needle at a parent-and-toddler-ridden Seaskate. We pressed on through Belltown, and our combined attention was caught by a record store advertising punk rock collectables.  After sifting through 7-inch vinyls of bands I don’t care to ever hear and soaking in the welcome relief of central air conditioning, we continued our trek to Downtown. There, roughly four miles into our quest, we cheated.  We opted to hop on the light rail for a couple miles worth of R&R down to Safeco Field, where we got a bite to eat and carried on.

At this point, we were hot. Our legs hurt.  As it turns out, it was easy for us to talk the talk, but walking the walk was more arduous than we had anticipated.  Skateboarding quickly lost priority and in the spotlight of the afternoon sun, the warehouses of SODO became dunes in the Sahara. Alki was no longer just our destination, but an oasis. My feet ached for the ice-cold waters of the Puget Sound, the thought of which became my primary motivation.  We did stumble upon a nearly unskateable DIY quarterpipe situated against an abnormally large jersey barrier along the Duwamish, but a few failed attempts quickly told us that it was not meant to be.   We put one foot in front of another, and climbed across the West Seattle bridge.  

I’ve never run a marathon, and I probably never will, but I’d imagine the stretch from the West Seattle Bridge to Alki beach was to us what the final leg of a marathon is to the long distance runner.  To add insult to injury, my three coats of sunscreen had not been enough to thwart off the deep shade of red that had found its way onto my chest by way of my v-neck t-shirt.  Crispy and fatigued (well, me at least), we got on our skateboards and began to push, ignoring the screaming in our legs, the thought of H2O consuming our minds.  It was roughly 6 o’clock when we arrived, triumphant, at our proverbial summit, the mediocre sands of Alki Beach. 

Admittedly, our arrival was somewhat anti-climactic.  As we stepped foot on the seaweed and litter-strewn beach, we were greeted by chants of “chug, chug, chug” and the sight of three alpha males cheering on a girl as she tipped a bottle of champagne skyward.  Alas, we made the most of our time there, basking in the glory of a trek completed, attempting to ignore the fact that our journey was really only half over.  

Perhaps our greatest stroke of good fortune, we discovered a semi-frequent water taxi running from West Seattle back to the city.  Five dollars later we were aboard.  As our nine o’clock ride swam east across the Elliot Bay, we took in a sunset that could only be described through the use of clichés, the likes of which I will spare you.  Our phones long dead, we sat back and took mental photographs of the tangerine sky emanating from the summits of the Olympic Mountains. As I thought back on the number of times I’ve taken note of that sunset over the past two year, I felt a great deal of satisfaction both in the completion of the day’s journey, and the completion of two wonderful years in an equally incredible city. I find it difficult to imagine falling in love with another city as I have Seattle, and though my departure may be eminent, I suspect my return may also be in the cards.
