Descending through the thick layer of clouds hovering over my destination, substantial pellets of precipitation rapped on my window to alert me at my arrival in an altogether unfamiliar place. Any new country brings with it certain anxieties, but this was a new continent, a new climate, a new world. After a smooth, air conditioned connection to KL Sentral train station and a quick and uneventful taxi ride to my hotel, I stepped out into a cloud of stagnant humidity, the gazes of local citizens just as hot on my jet lagged and overwhelmed back. I was quickly reminded of Sarajevo, and Dresden two years before that, to the surreal feeling one gets when arriving via plane in a faraway land. The feeling is of being thrown headlong into a world that has been existing without you - one that will continue to do so if you let it. I crawled into bed; I would deal with this in the morning.

In Nordic cultures, the sauna is a timeless tradition upheld throughout generations by apparent medicinal benefits that may or may not have backing in scientific fact. The act of sitting naked in a suffocatingly hot cell, forcing the body to release all varieties of toxins and evil spirits, is said to have a cleansing effect both physically and in the realm of the mind. Experiencing Kuala Lumpur for the first time is much akin to the Nordic sauna. Everything about the city tests one's physical capabilities, and challenges the senses to function at levels they have never before reached. 

To say it is hot does a great injustice to the stamina of the city's inhabitants. It is hot in New England in the summertime - in Kuala Lumpur it is oppressive. That first night in the city I returned from the ATM, only a few blocks from the hotel, looking and feeling as if I had swam there, not walked. Moisture accumulates in the air all day until it reaches its boiling point, at which time the skies give way to monsoon strength downpours. Livable temperatures resume for a brief spell before they rise once again to their sweltering heights. 

Caught in the swatches of stagnant air are a variety of odors, ranging from the Indian restaurant the beckons all who pass by, to the sewer running just beneath the sidewalk. As with the temperature, the smells of Kuala Lumpur are constantly turned to a volume significantly higher than is found in the comparatively bland and neutral Western Hemisphere. In accordance, the tastes accompanying the more pleasant end of the fume spectrum are explosive. If one makes it to the restaurant, food cart, or Tupperware toting bus stop vendor without becoming soaked in perspiration, chances are slim that they will make it through the meal without exhuming feverish volumes of sweat. Again, the most obvious description, in this case "spicy", does not do justice to the degree at which the benchmark is set. Eating in Kuala Lumpur is as much a trial of the taste buds as it is their pleasure. Throw in the stereotypically chaotic traffic, complete with scooter operators who utilize every inch of drivable surface, including the sidewalk, and the city, like the Nordic sauna, can be literally and figuratively draining. However, if one can adapt to the bombardment of the senses required to function in the Malaysian capital, the city is a pleasure in nearly every definition of the word. I have since moved on to the country's third largest city, Ipoh, but eagerly await the sights, smells, tastes, and fun that await me when I return to Kuala Lumpur before departing to Vietnam.
