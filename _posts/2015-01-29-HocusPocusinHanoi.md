On the day of my departure from Kuala Lumpur to Hanoi, I arrived at the airport abnormally early. I had not really intended to, but figured rather than lugging my backpack around the crowded city all day, my energy could be spent browsing duty free shops and magazine racks. When that became boring, I sat and breezed through the final half of the book I had been reading, Kurt Vonnegut's Hocus Pocus. Coincidentally, the narrative focuses around a Vietnam veteran named Eugene Debs Hartke, who regularly discusses his time in the very country to which I would be jetsetting later that evening. Another character who receives numerous mentions is Hartke's brother in law and fellow soldier, Jack Patton, whom the author makes a point to note was of no relation to the war general of the same surname. Vonnegut wastes no time in letting the reader know that Patton is killed in the Vietnam war, so I take no issue with disclosing that here.  The narrator remembers Patton on numerous occasions for his trademark reaction to events of varying levels of humor, coincidence, or irony, which is always a straight-faced "I had to laugh like hell." 

During my time in Hanoi, I found myself remembering these passages daily. Whenever something struck me as particularly absurd, I recalled the deceased character, thinking to myself, "I had to laugh like hell".  For instance, I had to laugh like hell the first time I stepped into an oncoming swarm of motorbikes, cars, and trucks, the frenzy of horns weaving in and out of one another and, sure enough, right around me as I played a life-threatening adaptation of Frogger.  However, That is simply the way one crosses the street in Vietnam; with blind faith and calculated movements. Ironically, given the worst case scenario, it's either adapt or die. Additionally, I had to laugh like hell every time I saw a car driving on an open road, sounding its horn at seemingly nothing and everything. If ever I needed proof that man is a creature of habit, it could easily be found in a lone Vietnamese driver honking relentlessly at an empty intersection. 

Traffic, however, is far from the only subject to have aroused such a jack Patton-esque response in me. One morning while trying to figure out what exactly the Ho Chi Minh Museum was trying to teach, I heard the hobbling of high heels closing in behind me. As I turned to investigate the source of the clatter, I was seized around the arm by the teenager who had so unsteadily crept up on me. Before I could accept or reject, she threw up a peace sign and struck a pose for her camera wielding friend, all the while hanging onto my undoubtedly disappointing bicep. This was not the first or the last time that an East Asian tourist had their photograph taken with me, but this was the only time in which I felt as if I the photo had been taken from me. On other occasions, there was some attempt at banter, or even a polite request, but here I was just another roadside attraction; proof that the individual had visited somewhere worthy of sharing on the internet. I watched the group of girls make their way around the museum, and again had to laugh like hell as I realized they, like so many others, were there simply because it was somewhere else to have their picture taken.

Lest you be led to believe that East Asian tourists were the only ones lame enough to conjure my inner jack Patton, I had to laugh like hell, perhaps in the most satisfying tones, every time I saw a white tourist, clad in elephant-print parachute pants -  standard issue, from what I can tell,  in southeast Asian hostels - timidly meandering the crowded streets of Hanoi's old quarter, the unmistakeable image of unease projected on their face as they wondered why nobody had greeted them with a coconut drink and a foot massage. Nothing quite puts a smile on my face like somebody who thinks they're cool being forced to reconsider that opinion.

I'd like to think that Jack Patton, Eugene Debs Hartke, and their creator, Mr. Vonnegut himself, would approve of my repeated invocations of the phrase that so accurately describes the book and much of the rest of the author's work. My experiences in Vietnam, unlike those of the characters in Hocus Pocus, have been largely positive, but I believe we are laughing like hell in the same vein; that is to say we are doing so when there is no point in argument. Though I acknowledge the humor in risking my life to cross the street, I understand quite clearly the danger in such pedestrian techniques. Likewise, being singled out simply for my appearance is an amusing novelty in small doses, but I suspect I would get quite sick of it were it to become a daily occurrence. I'm led to believe this by the fact that many people around the world have adamantly voiced this opinion. Finally, the cynical pleasure I get in mocking people who spend the majority of their time in tourist bars and hostel common rooms, while infinitely amusing, is one of the few instances in which I'm glad such a demographic exists. And for the sake of transparency, I'd be lying if I said that their fearful expressions weren't mirrored on my own face at times.

Yet, when considering my current situation, I'm forced to concede that there is really no point in getting worked up about any of these things. As Jack Patton did, or would have if he had been a real person and not a character in a book, I find that when faced with an event that might otherwise evoke frustration, anger, confusion, or fear, it is best to replace such emotions with good humor, and simply laugh like hell. After all, there is no better way to make sense of a situation that seems profoundly absurd than to note its inherent hilarity.
