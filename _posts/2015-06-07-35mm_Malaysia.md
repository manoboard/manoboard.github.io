In retrospect, it is unsurprising that black and white film is hard to come by in Malaysia. As I touched upon in my previous post about Kuala Lumpur, the city and country as a whole are vibrant in the most literal sense of the term.  To report on Malaysia without mention of color, would be a great injustice. Unfortunately, for somebody like myself with limited photographic skills, greyscale offers certain artistic advantages that color does not. In other words, it is much easier to pass off low quality black and white photography than it is low quality color. All in the name of art, of course.  As a result I have far fewer images to share from my month in Malaysia than from the preceding portion of the trip.
