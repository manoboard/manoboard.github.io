Given my storied history of minor but extremely frustrating skateboarding-induced injuries, it is a small miracle that I made it through the first seven months of my trip without any physical setbacks. Of course, as luck would have it, my first injury came just as I neared a region of the world that has drawn skaters for ages with its famous spots. The latest on my laundry list of sprains came at the Tseung Kwon O skatepark in northeastern Hong Kong, newly opened and absolutely incredible. To say it is the best skatepark I've been to on this trip does not do the design and construction justice. In truth, most of the parks I've skated so far have been subpar when compared to the ones I'm spoiled with back home. TKO on the other hand, is one of the most well laid out parks I've ever been to. There are lines in every direction, and one can hit nearly every feature in each section in one run. This might not work so well if the park were crowded, but when I arrived the ground was just drying up after some rain, and there were only two other skaters there. I quickly got to work finding my way around both open sections of park, my excitement growing each time I came out of one transition and found another feature waiting for me. I may have gotten a little too excited, however, and misjudged a line around a puddle, instead splashing right through the middle and going down. Not wanting to admit that I ached as badly as I did, I hopped back on my board and took off for another lap. By the time I made a loop around the park, my toe had stiffened to the point where I could no longer move it. This was not going to be a case of mind over matter, unfortunately. I sat down and took my shoe and sock off to inspect the damage, and was pleased to find my throbbing big toe only mildly swollen. It was not until I attempted to put my sock back on that I realized the situation was worse than originally diagnosed. I opted out of the sock, and was even more discouraged to conclude that the shoe wasn't going to work either - at least not in its current state. After removing the laces and opening up the tongue all the way, I gingerly slid my now useless extremity into a sweaty Puma slipper and limped over to the gate where the security guards had a chuckle at my expense before letting me out.

The majority of the next two days was spent in my closet sized hotel room with my foot up on a pillow. When I ventured out for food, I moved at a snail's pace, Hong Kong's 7 million residents swarming around me like bees to the hive. Finally, after seven months of cursing humankind's walking speed, I had found a place where people move at a satisfactory clip, and here I was getting in everyone's way. Add to this the fact that walking with a pronounced limp draws special attention from street salesman promising goods that will "make it feel better all weekend", and you've got a recipe for a less than sterling impression of a city. 

By my fourth day in the city I managed to get out and see a few sights.  Fewer locals pointed or gawked at my lack of mobility, which I took as a sign of great improvement. Though I didn't get to see a whole lot of Hong Kong, the parts I did see were visually impressive. The endless void of shopping malls, on the other hand, failed to win me over, but there is certainly no denying the power of the city's dual skylines locked in an eternal face-off over Victoria Harbor. By the time I left I was beginning to come around to Hong Kong's ultra-modern, multinational feel, but a slight change in schedule for the final leg of my trip meant that I had no time to spare. Hopefully my next visit will be more fruitful.
