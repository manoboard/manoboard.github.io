All the Balkan countries get a pretty bad rap in the minds of western civilizations, but Serbia holds a special position among the ranks of the world's most elite evil-doers. This is not an entirely unwarranted distinction.  After all, NATO has used military force twice in recent memory to curb the slaughter of human beings by the Serbian army. There is also the small matter of Slobodan Milosevic being the first thing anyone thinks about when they hear the word Serbia, which as a friend pointed out, is a PR nightmare.

In a similar line of thought to that which brought me to Albania, I found myself spending the last few days of my second month abroad in Belgrade, Serbia.  After visiting almost all the other former Yugoslavian capitals, I felt it unfair to leave Belgrade off the list.  I simply had to see the place capable of the atrocities which I had now learned so much about.  I had heard mixed things about the city itself before I visited, and though people did admit they found it interesting, they all commented that it was kind of a dump.  

I arrived in Belgrade after a 17-hour overnight train ride from the Montenegrin coast, the blaring October sun blinding my weary eyes. I had the mixed fortune of meeting a group of German and Russian guys early on in the journey, and boy, did they like to drink. This, coupled with the fact that the accommodations aboard the Bar-Belgrade railway are rustic at best, meant the vast majority of my first day in the "White City" was spent under a blanket.

When I emerged the next morning, I was determined to take on the city with full force.  However, to my great surprise, I found that the effort required to enjoy myself was quite minimal.  In fact, my affection for the place grew rapidly, and for this I felt a great deal of guilt. I had not wanted to like Belgrade, let alone love it.  My partiality to Bosnia and Herzegovina - Sarajevo in particular - had me hoping to find a city full of genocidal monsters.  Unfortunately, I just could not bring myself to do it.  Of all the cities I have traveled to in the Balkans, Belgrade reminds me the most of home; a notion that I suspect neither the American or Serbian governments would be happy to hear.

But what about all the negative things I had heard from other travelers? Admittedly, Belgrade is not a "nice" city. However, it is not a "nice" city in the same way that New York City is not a "nice" city. It is huge, hectic, and mildly intimidating. It lacks the outward welcoming vibe of Sarajevo, but its people are not cold by any means. I had a wonderful host with whom I drank coffee and chatted every morning, and I did not meet a single blatantly rude person in my four days there. At the same time, most did not go out of their way to say hello or inquire as to my nationality. Given America's rocky history with the former Yugoslav republic, I was not opposed to a little bit of space.  The people of Belgrade all look as if they have somewhere to be, and stopping to talk with a stranger would be an unnecessary detour; a characteristic that felt strikingly American.

In terms of aesthetics, the city resembles home as well.  Sure, the abundance of right angles and dirty brown and grey buildings display telltale signs of communism, but the cheap Chinese food, elegant dessert displays, and frequent hot dog carts give off a cosmopolitan vibe that is unmistakably 21st century.  Similarly, while my previous locations had me feeling somewhat out of place in matters of dress, I was delighted to see others in flannel shirts, pants with a bit of room to spare, and t-shirts with sleeves that nearly reached the elbow.  

Skateboarders, for the first time since I left home, appeared abundant, and before long I found myself on a team with a teenager named Aleksander playing a game of SKATE, which we lost, due primarily to my small bag of tricks.  The skatepark in Belgrade, despite a few wacky BMX influenced obstacles, is reminiscent of the back-and-forth style parks that became popular in the Northeastern US in the late 90s and early 2000s. Though not my first choice of genre, I sucked it up, popped some ollies, and found happiness in the simple fact that the ramps were not full of holes.

Behind the skatepark was a different story.  Droves of soldiers in berets and uniforms that looked as if they had not been altered since World War II bathed parallel lines of camouflaged army tanks.  Fighter jets periodically flew low overhead, and as it turns out the infantry was preparing for a visit from none other than Vladimir Putin.  I was immediately reminded that despite their similarities, Serbia is not America, nor is Belgrade New York City.  I made my way through the lines of armored vehicles, and caught the eyes of a few soldiers, who I realized very well may have been the same ones who slit the throats of unarmed Bosniak men just 20 years ago. Had I found my monsters? Even then, amidst their ranks were kind-faced cadets putting army helmets on the heads of curious children and showing them the insides of the tanks. Such gestures implied that perhaps these men had a human side, and that assuming they were all bloodthirsty killers was a bit presumptuous on my part. There is certainly no doubt that the Serbian army committed unspeakable acts during the most recent Balkan wars, but looking on as these men interacted with families compelled me to hold off on individual judgement for the moment.

Beyond the cavalry, life resumed as normal, and I walked along the area where the Danube and Sava rivers meet, a bit confused as to how anyone could call Belgrade rundown.  I wondered what travelers might say about American cities if this was their idea of a dump. It occurred to me that maybe after two months, my perceptions had changed, and that I would return to the United States and realize that Belgrade was indeed all I had been told.  At the moment however, I suspect that will not be the case.

It seems fitting that countries who consider themselves enemies should be so similar. It is often those who are the most alike who end up at odds, and I suspect the desire for power and individuality that drives both cultures is paramount in upholding tensions. Of course, kissing Putin's ass definitely doesn't help either, but if Serbia is as much like America as I think it is, the acts of its government and military speak only for a small fraction of the population.
