I've been back in the States for exactly a month now, and though I certainly miss traveling, I've had no shortage of excellent times since my return. Having not actually lived in Massachusetts for a couple of years, I guess I had forgotten the amount of fun parks within a reasonable drive of my parents' house. Sure, it's no Seattle, but I've come to realize that some of my favorite parks aren't the most perfect ones. Hopefully footage keeps piling up at this extraordinary rate, and I can keep a steady flow of these videos coming for your viewing pleasure.
