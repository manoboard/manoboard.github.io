I don't usually like the idea of going to a place simply to have been there, but when I realized that my itinerary would take me to just about every other country in southeastern Europe, I kind of had to go to Albania.  Even for somebody like myself, who aspires to be open minded in my perceptions of foreign lands, Albania still seemed to fall into that category of places "you can't just go to". In the western purview, it is the place where bunkers line the beaches and the bad guys from Liam Neeson movies plan their illegal activities.  This, of course, was all the more reason why I felt I should go. Accordingly, I decided to make a quick two-day jaunt just over the border to the country's second city, Shkodra.

The hour and a half bus ride from Ulcinj, Montenegro follows a winding road along mountainsides and through steep-walled canyons.  Consisting of one and a half lanes at its widest, it is used by every form of transportation imaginable from bicycle to motor coach.  On journeys like this I put a blind faith in the bus driver, and convince myself against common sense that when he passes a tractor while rounding a corner he knows what he's doing.

Upon my safe arrival in the city, I experienced my first real taste of what could most accurately be described as culture shock.   However, it was the setting, rather than the citizens, that had me overwhelmed. I suspect the word "beautiful" is rarely used to describe Shkodra - the surrounding landscape and Rozafa Castle; certainly - but the city itself; probably not. Nearly 50 years of communism and a couple of foreign occupations have left it in a rough state. However, as seems to be the case in most worse-for-wear places, the people of Shkodra could not be further in aura from their city of residence.  Everyone I met was exceedingly friendly and welcoming, even to a traveler who hadn't bothered to learn any of the language before visiting. Like anyone else, they browse the internet on smart phones, hang out in coffee shops and bars, and generally appear to live the same sorts of lives that people live in most cities on Earth. There are of course, a few exceptions, like the people selling fish in the street (like, not on the sidewalk), the storage-container-turned-mini-marts, and the every man for himself approach to driving.

I was not in Shkodra long enough to form a valid opinion of the place, but it gave me my first look at Albanian culture, which I will encounter again later this month when I travel to the country's "little brother", Kosovo. I went to sleep the night before my departure feeling satisfied with my decision to venture across the border. The events of the following day would have me thinking differently.

Stay tuned for part 2.
