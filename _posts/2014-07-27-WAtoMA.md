Well, I made it from Washington to Massachusetts in one piece thanks in large part to my Dad, who made splendid company.  I've got a few ideas for posts brewing, but in the meantime these photos have been burning a hole in my hard drive. Enjoy

This beautiful sunset over the Olympic Mountains bid me farewell the night before our departure.

Darrington is just west of North Cascades National Park, and offers some impressive scenery.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/14575598870" title="Diablo Lake, North Cascades National Park by Kevin Bicknell, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5566/14575598870_c8ceff9a70_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Diablo Lake, North Cascades National Park"></a>
The view over Diablo Lake in North Cascades National Park is pretty awe-inspiring.  The murky waters of the lake are less appealing.

One of our first glimpses of the "Carlton complex" wildfire.  We eventually got too close for comfort...

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/14739287196" title="Windfarm, Eastern WA by Kevin Bicknell, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3914/14739287196_8784f31892_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Windfarm, Eastern WA"></a>
I don't care much for the desert.  These windmills were a welcome sign of life somewhere just past Ellensburg, WA.

I don't recall the exact locaton of this photo.  The lack of smoke tells me it's somewhere in eastern Montana.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/14575643669" title="Downtown Livingston, MT by Kevin Bicknell, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3891/14575643669_e9710668e4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Downtown Livingston, MT"></a>
I'm a big fan of Livingston, Montana.  The town center is the perfect balance between modern and historic, and maintains a sense of authenticity rarely found in other "old west" style towns.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/14759940984" title="Gas Station Wunderkammer, South Dakota by Kevin Bicknell, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3850/14759940984_67b9f7f169_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gas Station Wunderkammer, South Dakota"></a>
I saw a hippo in the window of this South Dakota gas station at around 5:30am and took a peek through the glass.  This is what I found.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/14761962482" title="No Skateboarding, La Crosse, WI by Kevin Bicknell, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2930/14761962482_60d807549e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="No Skateboarding, La Crosse, WI"></a>
I went in search of the La Crosse, WI skatepark and though I failed to find it, my search was not in vain.  I came across these two perfect brick pyramids outside city hall.  Of course, right next to them was the "No Skateboarding" sign.  That's just rude.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/14762288175" title="&quot;Fledgling&quot; La Crosse, WI by Kevin Bicknell, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3835/14762288175_2b747c1b82_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="&quot;Fledgling&quot; La Crosse, WI"></a>
This statue was right around the corner from the brick pyramids.  Skateboarding seems to be at the front of La Crosse's mind, yet the skatepark was nowhere to be found.

It appears I didn't take any photos after La Crosse.  This side of the Mississippi just wasn't that exciting. My thoughts on the area between the coasts will come as soon as I get them down on paper.  Stay tuned.
