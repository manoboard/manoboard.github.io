In theory it is quite simple to visit Taroko Gorge from the nearest city, Hualien. There are buses departing every 40 minutes or so from the main train station that take visitors from the city through the national park, stopping at key points along the way. However, once inside the park, things become slightly more difficult for those unfamiliar with the area, which on both days I visited, accounted for 100% of the bus's passengers. The bus driver, who speaks as much English as I do Mandarin (none), only makes stops when requested. Thus, even with a map of the region and a list of areas of interest, it is next to impossible to know when each stop is arriving. Not wanting to miss anything, I chose a random interval at which to illuminate the "stop requested" light located conveniently above my seat. However, as I stepped out of the coach and onto the pavement of the narrow winding road situated low in the valley beneath misty peaks, I found it hard to believe that my coordinates were of any significance. There were no signs, no overlooks, and though the view of the river and mountains was quite remarkable indeed, I seriously questioned whether I had departed at the nearest official destination or the nearest wide spot in the road. Given my limited options, I resigned to a mode of transportation long outdated in most modern countries, but still viable in a land with the world's second lowest crime rate. I stuck out my thumb, put a smile on my face, and hoped for the best.

In mere minutes I was picked up by a pleasant older couple from Taipei, and when asked where I was heading, I pointed my finger and simply responded "that way". The husband and wife spoke decent English and I learned that they had friends in Seattle and had visited many times. They seemed a bit disappointed when I spotted a promising looking trail and asked to be dropped off, but alas, natured called in the lesser-used sense of the phrase.

The trail turned out to be somewhat of a dud, a short hike to a visitor's center that offered some of the park's least astounding views and most expensive snacks. The detour passed roughly three quarters of an hour, a large chunk of which was spent listening to a Russian man explain why he used to like Putin but no longer does, and why Obama might not be America's best president, but is far from the worst. I couldn't argue.

My second go at hitchhiking failed to provide as immediate of results as the first. I stood in the breakdown lane, the trail I had just descended climbing a steep hillside on my right, a vertical drop hundreds of feet to the river below on my left. With each echo of an engine in the nearby tunnel, I put on my nicest, most sympathetic smile, doing my best to give the motorists the opportunity to help a traveler in need while trying not to look too desperate. As the clock ticked away, I thought to myself that I should have shaved that morning. Finally, about a half hour later, a car came to a stop. A Toyota hatchback, reliable in more ways than one. Inside I was greeted by two friendly young women, and gave them the same destination as I had my previous chauffeurs. I initially found it odd that the passenger rode in the back, but as I turned from my position in the front seat, I realized that the car was more full than I had originally thought. In a car seat next to the rear passenger, was a three month old baby, and on the floor, a black and grey mixed breed pup, sitting attentively by the carrier's side. I came to learn that the driver, mother, and dog owner, Ellen, owns a hostel with her husband just outside the park's main entrance, and her passenger and longtime friend, Annie, was visiting from Taipei for a few days before returning to her job there as a flight attendant. 

I'd like to attribute the series of events that unfolded as a testament to my irresistible charm, but more likely it is a testament to the kind hearts and welcoming nature synonymous with Taiwanese people. I'm always quick to roll my eyes whenever another traveler describes how unrealistically "nice" a given people are, but in the case of Taiwan and its citizens, the description fits. Though I had originally intended only to accompany them so far as the next scenic vista, I ended up spending the day touring the park with Ellen, Annie, Cherry, and Dodo. Along the way, babies were ogled, puppies petted, curries consumed, selfies taken, and friendships made. The scenery wasn't bad either. Though I doubt I'll be quick to try my luck hitchhiking anywhere else in the world, in Taroko Gorge it was just the ticket.
