One of the goals I set before leaving home was to overcome the fear of making a fool out of myself in foreign countries.  I hypothesized that over the course of eight months I would embarrass myself so frequently that I would become desensitized to humiliation, and more outgoing as a result. Though I still have a lot of ground to cover before I have fully realized this goal, I do believe I am well on my way.

There are certain procedures that one becomes accustomed to when constantly moving overland from one place to the next. I have learned to load google maps onto my phone prior to leaving for a new destination, so that I may find my way upon arrival without the aid and expense of a taxi ride. I have learned to keep spare change ready in case there is a charge for luggage, and to fold my ticket carefully before placing it in my pocket so that it is not mangled when I hand it to the driver. I have learned to pick the side of the bus according to which direction promises the best scenery and the least sun. These items compose a mental checklist that I run through at the beginning of every journey. The desired result is the most stress free and enjoyable travel experience possible. Yet, there are times when I am reminded that my checklist is incomplete.

One of these situations arose while I was sitting halfway to the back of a bus preparing to leave the Skopje, Macedonia station. With 4 minutes until our scheduled departure, it occurred to me that the glass of water, glass of orange juice, and macchiato that I put in my stomach at breakfast would need to find their way elsewhere at some point. It also occurred to me that this would probably need to happen before the end of the three hour trip to Ohrid.  I scanned the platform but could not spot a bathroom. Not wanting to risk being left behind while I searched for one, I decided that nature would just have to wait.

Unfortunately, as the tires vibrated softly against the pavement, it became increasingly clear that the situation at hand might be more urgent than I had originally thought. I cursed myself for my oversight and hoped irrationally that we would be making a stop sometime soon.  

The bus merged onto the highway, and the passing scenery changed from high rises and intersections to rolling hills and farm lands. The situation grew more dire with every passing minute, and I was forced to consider my options.  Though not full, the bus was at a capacity greater than I would have cared for given the circumstances. I was unsure if the man sitting diagonal to me - the next closest passenger - could see into my row, but did not feel confident that I was hidden from his field of view. 

I have made a habit of carrying a bottle of water with me on every bus ride, another item on my mental checklist, and my gaze caught the vessel sitting on the seat next to me. Roughly a third full, I wondered about matters of volume. I concluded that if I were to take such a route, some, if not all of the water, would have to be consumed before the bottle could be put to use. This struck me as a dangerous and somewhat ironic assessment. If things did not go as planned, I would then have roughly 12 more ounces of liquid en route to my already full bladder, and I did not want to imagine what might happen when they arrived.

I also wondered about sound. I have never performed such a feat, and am unfamiliar with the acoustics of the act. The bus was silent aside from the gentle hum of the road, and my mind drew images of curious eyes searching the vehicle for the source of the sound of running water. The thought of running water did not help. I also took into consideration the fact that there was a police officer sitting a few rows behind me, and though I'm uncertain as to the Macedonian legal system's view on this sort of thing, I assumed that getting caught in the act would not be the best way to find out.

I stepped back from my contemplation and thought how ridiculous it was to be considering this as a solution to my problem.  "No" I told myself. "That is not an option."

While I racked my brain for other avenues, my body avidly reminded me of the time sensitive nature of the dilemma. It became increasingly difficult to focus, and I imagined the worst case scenario. Sure, it wouldn't kill me, but it would ruin my day and possibly the upholstery as well. Something had to be done, and quickly.

I wound my earbuds around my phone and tucked the bundle carefully into my chest pocket. Without making a conscious decision, I found my feet carrying me swiftly down the isle toward the bus driver and attendant. I squatted between the men so as to reach their eye level, and recited a line that I had become quite familiar with in the previous week.  

"Excuse me. I'm sorry, I do not speak Macedonian", I recited in Macedonian.

"Do you speak English?" I continued.

The attendant made a motion that said "a little", and the driver's lack of response explained that he did not. 

"I have to use a restroom. Are we going to be stopping anytime soon?" I asked calmly, knowing quite well that 15 minutes into the trip, "yes" was an unlikely answer.

"You need restaurant?" The attendant asked, confused.

At this point I knew I had to be blunt. All pleasantries off the table, I stated the word that I knew would have the desired impact; one of a handful of nouns understood worldwide. 

"Toilet."

The men carried out a short exchange before the attendant provided a response that I expected, but was not excited about.

"We stop one hours."

There are some messages that do not require translation. My eyebrows rose and cocking my head slightly to the side as if to say "no, no, you don't understand", I exhaled the sort of half laugh one releases when he wants to protest in the nicest way possible. This and the fact that I did not simply return to my seat conveyed that I had downplayed the necessity of a pit stop. The attendant and the driver exchanged a few more words and the bus pulled to the right and began to slow down. The door opened and I was out before we had reached a complete stop.  As I relieved myself onto a small pile trash, only partially hidden by the cover of some overgrown shrubbery, I recognized the absurdity of the situation.  Here I was, a 26 year old "man" urinating on the side of the highway with the gazes of a dozen strangers burning on my back. I began to laugh. Any embarrassment I felt was no match for the sheer bliss of no longer having to deal with this problem. I returned to my seat a new man, a shit-eating grin firmly plastered on my face. I thanked the driver and attendant, and prepared for a stress free and enjoyable travel experience.  As we pulled away I added another item to my checklist.
