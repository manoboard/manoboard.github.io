The word tourist evokes a lot of negative images in the minds of much of my generation, amongst whom it has become synonymous with overweight Americans in cargo shorts and fanny packs, more concerned about having their photo taken with an elephant than enjoying new experiences. Furthermore, it has become commonplace, perhaps justifiably, to think that America produces the world's worst of these monsters. This was certainly my understanding before leaving for my trip, and as I set out I carried amongst my socks and underwear a sizable ration of guilt - guilt that I hoped to rid myself of by proving to the rest of the world that Americans can be thoughtful and respectful people, even while abroad.  You can imagine my relief when I was told that my guilt may be a personal construct rather than an international standard.

This new and reassuring point of view came one chilly late September evening around a long oak table in the lone hostel of Zjablak, the town resting peacefully in the shadow of Montenegro's Durmitor National Park. I was not staying at the hostel - as you may have gathered by now, I have a certain disdain for accommodations of that variety - but if I were to return to Durmitor, I would stay there in a heartbeat. My only attempt at an explanation as to why I found the Durmitor Backpackers' Hostel so much more agreeable than any other in the world lies in the lack of attractions in the region. The park is just far enough off the beaten path
that the people who end up there do so because of genuine interest. There is no night life, no pub crawls; if you're there it's for the park and nothing else.

The hostel owner, Alex, a Montenegrin born and raised with more than a few ideas (well informed, of course) about the state of the world, had spent a number of years previously working in Budva, the country's most popular beach destination. During a conversation well lubricated by beer, wine, and complimentary shots of the Balkans' famous Rakia, I made some comment to Alex that jokingly acknowledged the guilt I carried with me as an American tourist. To my pleasant surprise, he explained that it is not in fact, American tourists that cause local blood to boil, but rather Russians. This was great news considering that criticism of all things Russian is strongly encouraged in American society. To paraphrase my host, he made the comparison that "American tourists travel to places because they at the very least have some interest in learning about them. Russian tourists want to go to a new country without leaving Russia". The statement pleased me at the time and took a little bit of the weight off my shoulders, though to be fair, if Alex owned a hostel elsewhere I suspect he might see things differently. Nevertheless, I have since seen much evidence to support the latter half of his statement. 

Now, now, I know what you're thinking. For the past six months, I have been a strong proponent of the idea that it is unfair and simply incorrect to generalize all people from a given country. I stand by that. So before I contradict myself too much, I'd like to make it clear that my direct interactions with Russian people over the course of my trip have been nothing but positive. However, the few days I recently spent in the beach city of Nha Trang, Vietnam, pushed my liberal belief system to the verge of collapse.

Nha trang is for Russians what Cancun is for Americans and Ibiza for the Brits; it is the place where people go when they want to have a tropical beach vacation without acknowledging that they've left their own country. All signs, menus, and promotional materials around the city are first printed in Vietnamese and Russian, with English as somewhat of an afterthought. Additionally, salesmen and women are often fluent in the Russian language, and the motherland's cuisine is available everywhere alongside standard Vietnamese dishes. Caucasian faces fill the bars and restaurants while locals toting racks of sunglasses or packs of cigarettes wander from lot to lot trying to make the most out of the foreign presence. The city illustrates an unfortunate irony visible in cities all along the picturesque Vietnamese coast. A country that sa
