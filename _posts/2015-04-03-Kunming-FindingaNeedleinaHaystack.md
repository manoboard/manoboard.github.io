I'm far from the first person to go on a skateboarding trip to China, in fact I'm pretty late to the game. Every city I've been to in the country so far has been home to at least one recognizable spot. Unfortunately, finding a specific spot in an unfamiliar city can be next to impossible without the aid of local knowledge. Before traveling to Kunming I had seen pictures of a "too good to be true" natural quarterpipe, but had no idea where in the city it was located. With a few hours to kill the night before my flight to Shanghai, I decided to go for a walk in a part of the city that I hadn't explored yet. About an hour into the walk, but still not terribly far from the hotel, a group of children climbing on something in front of a row of businesses caught my eye. I decided to investigate, and to my astonishment I had randomly stumbled upon the very spot that I had been keeping an eye out for since my arrival. Further surprising was that there was already somebody skating there. I struck up a conversation, and in less than a minute was literally running back to my hotel to get my skateboard. Shortly thereafter I was back and skating the most perfect street spot I had ever laid eyes on. The icing on the cake was the fact that people in China not only tolerate skateboarding, they seem quite enthusiastic about it. While we skated, children played, parents gave us thumbs up, and a security guard even hung out and watched. If such a structure were to be built in the United States, one would undoubtedly be reprimanded the second their skateboard touched the ground, but in China it was a bit of Sunday afternoon entertainment for all those in attendance.
