I really like hamburgers. I am well aware that I am not alone in my appreciation of this food. The hamburger, in fact, is so beloved in America that it has become somewhat of a symbol of American culture - which is kind of amusing considering everybody knows it was invented elsewhere. My intent here is not to explain how a food named after a city in Germany came to personify America, but rather to explain that Americans are not the only people who enjoy hamburgers.

This revelation descended upon me the other day, no surprise, while eating a hamburger.  Digging into a textbook example of "medium" topped with bacon and cheese, I began to ponder the concept of authenticity. This train of thought is nothing new to me. I spent the better part of a year interrogating the concept in the form of my masters thesis. Since then, authenticity has become almost entirely void of meaning to me. It's like when you say a word over and over again until it doesn't sound like a word anymore. I spent so much time considering all angles of the term that it lost anything resembling a standard definition.

Despite its ambiguity, the notion of authenticity remains a key component in the intentions of all those who consider themselves "travelers" rather than simply "tourists". A tourist is somebody who takes a vacation to a foreign country and remains on the beaten path. A traveler seeks out authentic cultural experiences that cannot be found at home. No doubt a noble endeavor, within the latter context the word "authentic" is often misunderstood to be synonymous with the word "different".  Within the latter context many would argue that hamburgers need not apply.

In Mark Twain's classic work of travel literature, *The Innocents Abroad*, there is a quote that addresses this desire for difference. He writes:

>_"We wanted something thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreign - foreign from top to bottom - foreign from centre to circumference - foreign inside and outside and all around - nothing any where about it to dilute its foreignness - nothing to remind us of any other people or any other land under the sun."_

For many years, this passage resonated closely with my dreams of traveling the world. I wanted to experience places far different from my home, and to return having uncovered profound truths about the nature of mankind - or some nonsense along those lines.  Now that my dream has become a reality, I have begun to rethink Twain's words. Where I once found pure enthusiasm for new and exciting experiences, I now find the trademark satirical rendering so famously associated with the author's work. Perhaps Twain's aim was actually to point out the absurdity in thinking that people outside of the United States live fundamentally different lives than us "normal" folk. Perhaps he too would note that eating a hamburger in Bulgaria, surrounded by Bulgarian people, is by default an "authentic" Bulgarian experience.

Perhaps I'm trying too hard to prove that I "totally get" Mark Twain. 

Regardless, it is safe to say that people in Sofia, Bulgaria probably spend far more time eating hamburgers than they do weaving bonnets or whatever it is we think Bulgarian people are supposed to do. Does this mean they are not authentic Bulgarian citizens? Of course not.

What turns a lot of people off about this, I suspect, is that eating a hamburger in Sofia doesn't yield the same sort of awe inspiring story that a week in the jungles of Borneo might. To my knowledge no memoir has ever been published on the subject. Sure, such an experience might not teach one a whole lot about the history of a place, but then again neither does going out drinking with a group of Australians from the hostel - but for some reason that still seems to appeal to most "travelers".

Travel does not always have to be difficult in order to be authentic. While there is definite benefit in putting oneself in situations one might not encounter back home, every day need not resemble an episode of "Survivor Man" in order to provide a greater understanding of how people in other countries live their lives. There were times early on in my journey in which I wondered if I were doing it right. I worried that perhaps I wasn't getting the "authentic" experience that I was looking for; that is to say, I worried I might not be getting an experience entirely "different" than I would back home.  I have since come to realize that the differences one desires present themselves with time, and are bookended by countless experiences that are not so blatantly profound. My advice to the aspiring globetrotter setting out in search of "something thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreign" is to not be surprised when it doesn't turn up right away. I might also remind them that eating a hamburger in Bulgaria while surrounded by Bulgarian people, is something that can only happen in Bulgaria, and to think again when questioning the "authenticity" of such an experience.
