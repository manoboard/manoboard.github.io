The Sarajevo skatepark is not "good" by western standards.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that if the park were located in the United States, it would have been considered an eyesore and a safety hazard years ago, and would no longer exist.  However, the park is not located in the U.S., and the people of Sarajevo don't complain about its rotten plywood, missing screws, or dangerously loose sheet metal transitions.  They don't sing the park's praises either, but simply make the most of what they have at their disposal.  From what I'm told, the park here is the best of the two in the country.  It is used so extensively in fact, that at times I have found myself questioning whether or not the missing sections of deck or holes in the ramps are actually a problem.  Could it all be in my head?

Skateboarding is not the most popular choice of recreational activity in Sarajevo.  After my first week in the city, I had resigned to the conclusion that people really didn't skate there at all.  Every time I went to the park, I was the only person there, and though I spotted a waxed ledge every once in a while, I had seen only one person riding a skateboard who looked like they had any sort of idea what they were doing.  It was not until a dreadlocked young man and his heavy metal haired friend waved me over to the ledge they were sitting on one afternoon, that I was introduced to the small, but passionate group of skaters in the city. Next thing I knew, I was sitting in an apartment sipping strong black Bosnian coffee and watching a Slovenian skate video.  The young man, whose name I could barely pronounce, let alone spell, commented to me that "when you skateboard, you have friends everywhere"; a statement that has since been proven quite accurate.

A few hours later, my new friend and I arrived at the skatepark, which had magically come alive. It turns out, like everywhere else in the world, people in Sarajevo wait until the temperature drops or work lets out to go skateboarding. Go figure. In many ways, the scene at the skatepark could have been lifted out of its location and dropped in any city in any part of the world. Present were those who were head and shoulders better than everyone else, those playing S.K.A.T.E on an open section of park, and those there sans skateboards, indulging in the social opportunities that such a setting provides.  Noticeably absent however, was the negativity and exclusivity synonymous with American skateparks.  In Bosnia, there are no lame tricks; a double flip is better than a kickflip because two flips is more than one.  It's quite simple.

I was approached and greeted by every skater who arrived at the park, who all had the same question, "where are you from?"  They asked not necessarily because I stuck out as an American, but rather that the skateboarding community in the city is so small that everybody knows each other.  Thus, when a new face appears at the park, they know the person is from out of town.  In talking to these people (who all speak beautiful English) I learned that while Bosnia's skate scene is small (but growing), the one in Croatia is much larger.  Why the discrepancy between the two neighboring countries, you ask? Well, there are a couple reasons.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/15126044645/" title="image by manoboard88, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3907/15126044645_a5b9ca1972_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="image"></a>

First, Bosnia was hit the hardest by the war of the 90s, so while Croatia, Slovenia, and even Serbia were beginning to take interest in things like skateboarding, people in Sarajevo were dodging sniper fire on the way to the bread queue. Even after the Dayton Agreement was put into place, building a skatepark was not high on the list of priorities in the city.

Secondly, skateboards in Bosnia, for whatever reason, are wildly expensive. One skater mentioned that a Mini-Logo deck, which might run someone 40 dollars in the U.S., goes for roughly 150 Bosnian Marks in a local shop. Even with the highly favorable exchange rate, that is a great deal more expensive for a bottom of the barrel deck than in the United States.  Taking into consideration that most Sarajevans do not have a surplus of wealth to spend on such luxuries, it makes sense that cost would deter a large portion of the possible audience.  This also accounts for the large number of badly chipped and razor-tailed decks begging to be retired, but with many more months of skating ahead of them, around the skatepark.

Yet, the small community of skaters in the city, and the lack of participation in the activity throughout the country, has it's advantages.  Most notably of all these is the absolute lack of attitude from people at the park.  As I mentioned, I was greeted by all the skaters present, but I was not the only one they were socializing with.  In direct contrast to the United States, the skateboarders were quite friendly to the two rollerbladers present, who were simply part of the crowd.  Additionally, the large group of parkour enthusiasts on the outskirts of (and sometimes inside) the park were also welcomed enthusiastically. Any negative commentary that I might have had reserved for those practicing their distinctly Eastern European brand of urban gymnastics was quickly silenced when one participant, clad in running shoes and oversized sweatpants, hopped on his buddy's skateboard and easily landed a 360 flip on the bolts, first try.

The explanation for this distinct lack of discrimination is that the community is too small and young to hate itself or others just yet.  In the United States, skateboarding has ammassed such a huge following that it has naturally become oppositional and exclusive.  Here, the scene is so small that they're still happy to have people around sharing the same space.  Had this evening at the skatepark been my only experience in the country, I would find it hard to believe that Bosnians even knew the meaning of words like hatred or discrimination.  Here was the most utterly cliche example of acceptance and inclusion that I've ever seen.  Present were a managerie of skin tones, clothing styles, and choice of recreational activity. When discussing skateboarding in the area, the locals spoke only of "Balkan" skaters, not Serb or Bosniak or Croat, not Muslim, Christian, or Orthodox, simply Balkan.

Perhaps most satisfying about the situation was that it gave me confirmation as to why I was there in the first place.  Back in February when I sent in my application for the Bonderman Fellowship, I proposed that skateboarding is a universal language, and offers a unique opportunity through which to meet people wherever one may travel.  Though I have not gone far enough to confirm whether or not it is in fact "Universal," I can say for sure that it at least translates into Bosnian.
