Taiwan’s Central Mountain Range, as its name suggests, runs lengthwise down the middle of the country, creating a natural divide between the east and west coasts.  Compliant with its uninspiring moniker, the Range’s history as both a physical and ideological barrier is likewise understated.  Over the centuries, as European and Asian powers encroached upon the island dubbed Formosa, they comfortably laid roots in western settlements which have since grown into the country’s largest cities.  Though such invasive cultures eventually diffused their way across the divide, Taiwan’s eastern shore remains drastically less affected, at least aesthetically, by the economic bustle of its other half. 

A city of just over 100,000 inhabitants, Taitung City constitutes one of the larger concentrations of people along the island’s right-hand side.  Though not remote by definition, a blanket of lush vegetation draped over hilltops abutted by coal-grey beaches provides a deceptive backdrop for such an accessible town. In sharp contrast to western cities like Kaohsiung and Taipei, which remind visitors of close ties to mainland Asia, Taitung gives off an air that is distinctly Pacific Island.  Despite its proximity to more archetypal locales, the city feels distant from its brethren. Accordingly, it is the perfect setting for a ritual that seems nothing short of otherworldly.

Somewhat of an afterthought in my circumnavigation of the island, Taitung served primarily as a convenient stopping point en route to the more popular destinations of Haulien and Taroko Gorge. I set out on foot with few expectations on my first morning in the city, slowly making my way toward the ocean; a concrete ceiling of clouds shielding me from excessive sun and heat. With only a vague destination in mind, I was open to whatever diversions might present themselves.  The pace of the city felt slow, a fact that would have been more striking had this not been within the final days of the Lunar New Year celebration, a time in which most businesses shut down and all movement outside the home is limited if any. 

Shortly into my walk I heard the machine-gun crack of a strip of fireworks erupt nearby.  This too was not alarming.  One does not require a great deal of experience with Lunar New Year festivities to learn that minor explosions play a large role in the celebration.  I had always thought such measures possessed a characteristically American flare, but have since revised my assumption.  What struck me as unusual in this instance however, was that the sound did not cease for quite some time  From what I could tell, this promised to be the largest fireworks display I had yet to encounter. Naturally, my interest was piqued. As I rounded a block of buildings and made my way across a near empty parking lot toward the origin of the commotion, my eyes were met with a cloud of smoke consuming a seemingly unfazed crowd.  As I drew within coughing distance, the shape of a masked man, naked to the waist in red athletic shorts, holding a single leafy bow, emerged at head height from the haze.  He seemed calm despite the situation, his tattooed torso dotted with a leopard print pattern of char.  The pandemonium died down momentarily and more of the scene came into view.  The young man was positioned on a sedan of sorts, supported by men of all ages, each wielding an arsenal of firecrackers.  Unlike the exposed participant, these pallbearers all wore protective clothing. Their hands were set securely in workingman’s gloves, the cuffs tucked into uniform track jackets, each emblazoned with the word “Handan” across the shoulders. I watched, my mouth agape, as the young man was let down from his perch and another equally underdressed peer took his place.  Without delay, fuses were lit and the procession resumed, the new idol being paraded around while the surrounding mob pelted his bare skin with an assault of fireworks. Fighting suffocation and resisting simultaneous urges to plug my ears and shield my eyes, I defied the reflex to step back for fear of missing something entirely foreign to my worldview.

Though the event itself is well documented, definitive explanations as to the origins of the “Bombarding Handan” tradition are less readily available.  By some accounts, Handan is a God represented by the eager, albeit reckless young man, and the pyrotechnics with which he is blasted are the offering of warmth.  Some claim Handan was a military officer of Godlike wealth, and by throwing firecrackers in his direction, citizens increase their own chances of fiscal improvement.  Other versions attest that Handan was a gangster and gambler, and the fireworks a method of repentance for his sinister actions.  There are even rumors that the smoke from the celebration once curbed the spread of infectious disease, contributing to its acceptance and promotion amongst local officials. Though justification for the ritual varies, there is a consensus surrounding the notion that, like pretty much everything else around New Year’s, the ultimate result is good fortune for all involved.

I have since discovered that the popularity and shock value of this once unique festival have caught the eyes of Taitung’s western neighbors, and it is now replicated amidst the contrasting cities along the country’s other coast.  In this way, Taitung and Handan, whoever he may have been, have sparked a reverse cultural diffusion, sending their celebration across the Central Mountain Range in the direction of cities in which modernity threatens to overshadow tradition.
