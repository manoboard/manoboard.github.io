I dont have a bucket list, but if I did, I would add "skate the 1984 Winter Olympics Bobsled track in Sarajevo" to it, then cross it off.   After hiking up to the track a couple days earlier, I was unsure if skating it would actually work.  The track is roughly 3 feet wide, and every once in a while there are two to three inch cracks where the segments of concrete that compose it meet.  Add the threat of lingering landmines in the surrounding area, and a number of reasons can be thought of as to why riding a skateboard on the track is probably a terrible idea.  However, I could not help but feel an emerging sense of regret each time the thought of leaving the city without at least trying entered my mind. Consequently, I found myself trudging up the winding dirt road that had me questioning my fate just two days earlier - skateboard in hand - wondering again if I would return uninjured; but this time for far different reasons.  It was my last day in Sarajevo, and I figured even if the track proved impossible to skate, I could enjoy a few final panoramic views of the city. Luckily, the cards were in my favor, and on that day I would have my cake and eat it too.

I started off small, making my way maybe 50 feet up the track, removing pebbles and other potentially deadly debris as I went.  I dropped in cautiously, and to my great pleasure found that the aforementioned cracks were navigable with a small amount of maneuvering.  After a couple slow-paced practice runs, I gradually worked my way higher and higher up the apparatus, each time wondering if I was pushing my luck. Skating the track was much like skating a pool; it took a few runs to get a feel for it, but once I figured it out, I could hardly contain myself, and the thought of going faster and faster consumed me.  I took lap after lap for a couple of hours, and finally called it a day.  Unscathed and utterly satisfied with myself, I descended the mountain having put the perfect bookend on the first stop of my incredible journey.
