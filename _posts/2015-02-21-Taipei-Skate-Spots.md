One of my favorite things about skateboarding is that I can travel to a city on the other side of the planet and recognize architectural features that residents probably walk by every day without considering. Of course, there are structures around the globe that anybody would know - the Eiffel Tower, Taipei 101, the Great Wall of China, and many more - but there is something particularly satisfying about recognizing a railing or bench, that even the wonders of the world can't compete with. The exclusivity of these bits of knowledge, and the connections they form between people who share them, make involvement in skateboarding much more rich and profound than simply riding the board.

This is without even taking into consideration all the new spots one finds when visiting a city. I need not go into detail about how skateboarders "see the world differently"; we've all heard that a million times before. But it's true, and this element of the hunt makes exploring a new place that much more fun. The excitement one experiences when they encounter a skate spot in the wild is unique to this population. Certainly all communities have their own meaningful landmarks, but with skateboarding the database is ever growing, and affords each participant the opportunity to contribute. The mediocre skateboarder can learn to read the landscape in largely the same manner as a professional. 

Skateboarding is participatory on all levels - It doesn't stop when one steps off the board or leaves the skatepark. This is not the case with all activities. I can't say for sure, but I don't think your average high school quarterback goes walking around a city thinking "man, I'd love to throw a touchdown pass over those stairs". Even if he does, he certainly doesn't then get his buddy to film him doing it.

Before I get too far into the myriad ways in which skateboarding is better than football, let me get to the point of this post. It's no secret that Taipei's cityscape lends itself nicely to skateboarding. In the past couple of years alone, numerous teams have sent their riders on tours of the city (and elsewhere in the country) and the spots are popping up all over the place in American magazines and videos. During my time there, I recognized many of these spots, and came across many more that I had never seen before. Here is a sampling of what I saw.
