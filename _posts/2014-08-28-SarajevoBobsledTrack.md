Remember that time I said this blog was going to talk about skateboarding?  Well it is, I promise.  I had a whole post about skateboarding almost completed, but then I decided to take a hike up to the bobsled track from the 1984 Olympics, and it was way too exciting not to share.  So for now, the skateboarding will have to wait.  Technically speaking however, it is not out of the question to think that one might be able to ride a skateboard on this track.  
In fact, if I feel compelled before I leave the city, I may make the trek back up there and give it a whirl.

Getting to the track is no easy task, and requires scaling one of the many peaks surrounding Sarajevo.  I looked up directions on Google Maps before I departed, but I'm somewhat skeptical as to how accurate they are in this part of the world.  I'm certain the route I took was not the quickest, but I'd venture a guess that few others offer the same experience.  My trek began by winding through densely populated neighborhoods, while rapidly gaining altitutde.  The grade of the hill for most of the hike was quite steep, and didn't really mellow out until the very top of the mountain.  

I took a wrong turn somewhere along the line, but I'm glad I did because the overlook I came across was nothing short of breathtaking. After backtracking slighly, I was once again on course, and continued climbing as the houses became more sparse and the road narrowed.  Eventually, the pavement ceased, and the road turned to dirt and gravel.  I did not remember seeing anything about dirt or gravel roads when I researched how to get to the bobsled track prior to my quest.  I did however, see a number of warnings about active landmines leftover from the war.  Thus, with each step a small voice in the back of my mind wondered "Will this be it? Will this step be my last?"  I considered turning back, but at this point I had simply come too far to quit.  I rationalized my decision by noting traces of tire tracks or litter along the side of the path. These were signs that people had been here, right?  I wondered to myself how long it would take for tire tracks to be washed away; could I be looking at tread marks from 20 years ago?

Just as I began to think I had missed my mark, and was simply wandering around a known minefield, the scenery opened up and I saw a sight that immediately eased my mind: two bombed out houses full of bullet holes.  This, of course, is not a sight typically associated with a sense of relief. However, it was not the houses themselves that excited me, but rather the graffiti adorning one of them.  One of the many "M. Chat" pieces found around the city, it was dated 2011, meaning the French graffiti artist, Thoma Vuille, had likely walked this same path just three years ago.  My morale was given an instant boost, and my pace quickened.  I continued to wind up the now heavily eroded path, and finally came upon my destination.

The bobsled track itself is quite impressive.  I spent about an hour climbing around on it, trying to picture what it had been like to race down the structure with the eyes of my country anticipating my every move.  I also spent a good deal of time trying to decide if it is skateable.  If I do return with my skateboard, I'll be posting again about this place, but if not here are a few photos from the journey for you to enjoy.


The first of many stunning views along the way.

I took a wrong turn and came across this graveyard littered with what appeared to be extremely shallow graves.

But then the view was really nice, so I didn't really mind

Once I found my way again, the road began to narrow...

And then there wasn't much of a road at all...

But then things began to open up, which took my mind off the threat of landmines.

These "houses" and graffiti were a welcome sign of life.

I made it unscathed!

I ran into these cool dudes, but they were pretty busy.

These little guys were scurrying about all over the place.

Heavy Metal Music!

Every so often there were holes in the concrete.  These holes were created so guys with guns could stick their guns through the track and shoot at other people who may or may not have had guns. The war may be over, but there are traces of it everywhere in Sarajevo.
