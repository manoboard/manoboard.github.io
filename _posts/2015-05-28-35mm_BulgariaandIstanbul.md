It was the end of November, and I was nearing the completion of 4 months of travel.  Sofia, like any city above a certain parallel, was feeling the unwelcome onset of winter.  Temperatures seemed to plummet lower and lower with each coming day, and nearly every morning when I stepped out onto the street, the peak of nearby Mt Vitosha was draped in a fresh blanket of snow.  With my flight to Malaysia just a couple weeks away, now was not the time to purchase winter clothes. Accordingly, I made do with what I had; a long sleeve shirt, two flannel button ups, long johns, sweatpants, and of course, my red woolen beanie.  Perhaps not the most efficient protection against the elements, the outfit got the job done. Unfortunately, one of the many downsides to wearing my entire wardrobe at once was that such a large pile of layers restricted movement quite a bit. Add in the blistering cold and skateboarding became a decreasingly attractive mode of transportation. 

What was I to do? 

Yes, there are countless historic sites and museums in the city to visit, but one can only see so many attractions in one day before they are burnt out; and then what?

One brisk morning I came across a small flea market of sorts, and amongst the tables was a merchant selling a wide array of analog cameras.  After a bit of wheeling and dealing I walked away the proud owner of a late 1980’s 35mm camera, a FED 5 to be exact.  FED, it appears, was the Soviet Union’s answer to Leica. When the German manufacturer ceased all exports to the Union during World War II, Moscow was left to fill the hole in its camera supply itself. The result was a far inferior brand of rangefinder cameras, modeled closely after the former favorite. I won’t use the word “knock-off”, but others might.

Having never used a rangefinder camera, and possessing only a basic knowledge of aperture and the like, the rolls of film I shot over the course of the following months were as much an experiment as anything else. For the most part they came out bad. Like, really bad. But a few shots here and there stood out as acceptable. I’ve only now gotten around to the laborious task of scanning the negatives, so I plan to share my favorites in bunches as I have them ready.
