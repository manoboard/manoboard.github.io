I’ve already elaborated in some depth about my experience visiting Hanoi. If you want to read more about that, take a look at my initial [post](http://manoboard.com/2015/01/29/HocusPocusinHanoi/) on the subject.  The purpose of this entry is not to further expand upon the relative chaos that greets one upon their arrival in the city, but rather to share some snapshots taken with my now trusty FED 5 camera. Simply put, Hanoi is photogenic. The same could be said about Vietnam as a whole. Between Hanoi and nearby Ha Long Bay, I captured a number of scenes that I’ve deemed worthy of sharing, thus making this the first in a two part 35mm post.
