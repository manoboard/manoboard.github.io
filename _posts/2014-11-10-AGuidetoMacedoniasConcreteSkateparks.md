Skateparks are not as common as I would like in southeastern Europe.  Most countries only have one or two, and even then they are usually of questionable quality.  The flowing concrete snakeruns of the American northwest are but a Balkan pipe dream. Around here, the "good" parks tend to resemble something out of the 1999 Gravity Games. In fact, for the first couple of moths of my travels, the only concrete features I skated were two bumpy quarter pipes in Dubrovnik, Croatia. Little did I know the concrete parks of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would make those look like fine tuned marvels of engineering. 

For the sake of transparency, I have not been to every skatepark in the country. For all I know there is some pristine bowl sitting behind a Yugo factory somewhere that draws skateboarding pilgrims from near and far with its flawless transitions and smooth-as-a-baby's-bottom coping. Based on what I saw though, that is pretty unlikely.

## **1. Skopje**

In the capital's defense, they did put the finishing touches on a brand new Masonite park this summer, which despite being more suited for the BMX crowd, is actually pretty fun.  There is also an area just down the street, in the heart of the city center, where some skateboarders frequently session a handful of ragamuffin features.  I'm all for cultural experiences, but no amount of local flavor is going to compel me to skate a rusty flatbar in front of a crowd of tourists when there is a perfectly good miniramp a mile away. It is nice that the city gives them this space, though. Municipal tolerance of things of this nature is unheard of elsewhere in the region.

Tolerance however, can only win a city a certain amount of credit. The third of Skopje's designated skate areas consists of a mind boggling pair of concrete-laden holes in the ground.  There are parks in the US that are so bad they're actually kind of fun, but sadly this one cannot even be granted that distinction. I struggle to imagine what was going through the minds of the city officials who ok'd the design of this Picasso-esque slab, but I'd imagine it went something like this.

Official 1: We need a skatepark, what kind of things do skateboarders like?

Official 2: They're always jumping over the stairs at the courthouse, how about that?

Official 1: Sounds good. Stairs it is.

Official 2: I saw some riding down the railings by the stadium. Took the paint right off!

Official 1: Ok railings too, then.

Official 3: The other night when I got home to my mansion I found a group of the bastards riding around in my pool!

Official 1: Alright, stairs, railings, pools. Do we know anyone who can build this sort of thing?

(Silence)

Official 1: Oh well, how hard could it be? My brother Milosh has a concrete mixer, I'll see if he'll do it.

The result is a bizarre mashup of features that would be terrible even if they were placed by themselves.  If the park has any saving grace, I suspect it is hidden deep beneath the trash and campfire debris that make it physically impossible to skate.

## **2. Ohrid**

Nowadays everyone and their mom are embracing the DIY aspect of skateboard culture. And why not? It is people building skateparks for free on forgotten patches of urban wasteland.  If I were a city I'd be all over that. Accordingly, a lot of homemade features are popping up from the hands of novice craftsmen, and bumps and faulty transitions are just part of the experience. If the Ohrid park were a DIY project, I might cut them a bit of slack, but from what I understand it was a city planned and funded endeavor.  Granted, of the three concrete parks I skated in the country, it was the most fun, but that characteristic hardly warrants praise. The bowl, with its circular shape and mellow transitions, resembles more of a frying pan than it does its namesake. Not that this matters, because there are large patches of grass and gravel in the middle that prevent it from being ridden. Come to think of it, I'm yet to find a bowl in the the country that one could actually skate if one felt so inclined. The rails scattered around the park are fun enough, and the quarter pipes, with their rusted angle iron coping, are good for a scratch or two. Unfortunately, the lot upon which the park sits is so heavily blanketed in pebbles that one might mistake it for an Adriatic beach. With a thorough sweeping and a wholehearted attempt to overlook the fact that taxpayer money went into this dump, it might pass a couple hours nicely.

## **3. Bitola**

The final park on my list is the one that has me shaking my head the most.  While the first two suffer from significant design flaws, the Bitola park suggests that whoever built it had never seen a skateboard, let alone a skatepark. The only possible explanation that I can come up with is that when the city officials sat down to draw up the plans for the new board zone, they grabbed a few two liter bottles of Skopsko and went to town in the park editor feature of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater for PS1. I suspect this is why they thought that a roll-in functions in exactly the same way as a quarterpipe, and decided to place coping atop the two that would later be built.  I also suspect they had the infinite balance cheat enabled, which would explain the roller coaster rails lining the perimeter. On the bright side, the Bitola park was relatively debris free, but there were enough other flaws that this was only a minor victory.

One might read this and argue that I'm being a bit harsh. After all, not every city can have a city-wide skatepark plan like Portland and Seattle. However, the fact that I did not spot a single other person using these parks in my two weeks in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia suggests to me that I'm not their only critic.
