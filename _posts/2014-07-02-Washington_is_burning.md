I awoke to my phone alarm at 5am and climbed out of the canyon that had formed in my slowly leaking air mattress.  Today was the day - I had known it was coming, but never quite expected it to happen - I was leaving Seattle. My Dad had flown out a couple days earlier to help me pack and to serve as company on the long drive east.  Within an hour we loaded my remaining belongings into the car, grabbed coffee, and hit the road.  As we merged onto I-5, I officially made the claim that I would return to Seattle someday.  Had I known that “someday” actually meant “later today”, I might have chosen my words more carefully.

Our plan was to drive through North Cascades National Park via route 20, heading east and ending our first day in Missoula, MT.  Not knowing when we would get another chance to see the North Cascades, we decided the slight detour would be worthwhile. Had I known we would cross those mountains twice in that day, I might have reconsidered.

There is no denying the beauty of the North Cascades.  I’ve spent my fair share of time in mountain ranges around the country: Four years in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, a little over a year in California’s Eastern Sierras, and two years in (ok, “close to”) the Cascades of Washington State.  Of the three, the Cascades take the cake, no question.  In my eyes they’ve got it all; the grandeur and majesty of the Sierras spun with the dense green vegetation of the Whites.  They embody a vague resemblance of home with the air of something completely new.  Their climate extends west to Seattle, making the city one of the most lush and visually appealing I have ever laid eyes on. The eastern side of the range however, I am not so partial to.  Beautiful in their own right, desert landscapes just aren’t my cup of tea.  Something about looking over miles of desolate sand-covered hills strewn sporadically with sagebrush makes a primal sensor in my brain go off.  The blatant lack of water and life puts me on alert, for the possibility of death by dehydration is closer in these parts than on the coast.

As we descended from the National Park, thirst quickly lost precedent to a more immediate reality: wildfire. At this point I had never seen a wildfire first-hand.  We knew well that there were a number of them burning in the center of the state, but to our knowledge they would cause no difficulty for our travels.  Yet, as we drew closer and closer, the situation at hand became clearer, and we began to understand that we were indeed heading into the belly of the beast: the “Carlton Complex” wildfire as it became known in national headlines.

Looking back, there were signs of distress that we should have picked up on.  As we rolled into the Central Washington town of Twisp, we encountered a line of cars extending about a quarter mile from a gas station.  Shrugging this off and optimistically noting our half-full tank, we kept on.  As we continued, the smoke grew in quantity and closed in proximity.  After spotting a couple of water toting planes and helicopters, our concerns began to multiply when we encountered a barricade across route 20; the road we had planned on taking all the way to Okanagan, where we would branch off toward I-90.  Refusing to consider the possibility that our way might be aflame, I whipped out my phone, and found a new route through the town of Petreros via route 153.  We would later find out that the entire town of Petreros had burned to the ground the day before, but for now our hopes remained high.  Whatever it took, we were not going back to Seattle.

As we headed south on 153, the situation rapidly deteriorated.  Save a few other civilian cars, the majority of the traffic we encountered was emergency vehicles.  The scene that soon surrounded us can best be described as post-apocalyptic.  The wind was blowing in incredible gusts, smoke consumed the hillsides all around us, the skeletons of burned-down houses and cars littered the landscape, and fires crackled and spread on both sides of the road.  I snapped photos on my phone as I could, but soon an all too real fear that we might get caught in this wildfire grabbed my attention and held it.  We spotted a woman talking to the driver of a red pickup at the end of a dirt driveway, and seeking reassurance pulled up alongside her to ask if the road were open ahead.

“Yeah, they said if you can get out that way to do it.  The telephone poles are falling over up ahead”

Realizing the woman may not have understood the nature of our desire to proceed, we thanked her and closed the car window.  She had inadvertently made our decision for us.  We made a U-turn and drove as quickly as the road would allow back in the direction from which we had come.  Defeat was upon us, but at this point pride was the last thing on our minds.  We would need gas if we were to head back over the Cascades. In a matter of miles, our tank had gone from half-full to half-empty, and we had a lot of ground to recover.

Roughly 5 hours later we found ourselves sitting in rush hour traffic in Bellevue, just across lake Washington from where we had departed that morning.  Some might argue that my temper shows when I’m driving.  Growing up and learning to drive in Massachusetts, I see my driving style as nothing out of the ordinary.  However, if I were ever to succumb to road rage, it would have been in that bumper-to-bumper traffic along I-405.  

At the end of the day we found ourselves in a roadside hotel in Ellensburg, WA a mere 107 miles from Seattle.  More frustratingly, we were now a day behind schedule.  The only salve to our wounds was the newfound knowledge that route 153 had closed almost immediately after we began our retreat, and that had we gone any further we would have risked running out of gas in the middle of the most devastating wildfire in the state’s history. We resigned to an early start and a long drive the next day, hoping to make up some of the ground we had lost. Had we been stubborn, we could have lost much more than time.
