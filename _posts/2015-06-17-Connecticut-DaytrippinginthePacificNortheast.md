There are two types of people inhabiting the Nashoba Valley of Massachusetts: beach people and mountain people. The distinction is simple; beach people are wont to head south down 495 or route 3 for vacation, often to the cape, Rhode Island, or similar faux-tropical climes. Mountain people migrate in the opposite direction. My family falls into the latter category, meaning that all my childhood vacations were spent amongst New Hampshire’s White Mountains. As a result, it was not until relatively late in my adolescence that I crossed the border into the strange rectangular chunk of land just an hour south of my hometown. Though accustomed to traveling great lengths to go snowboarding up north, Connecticut, despite entailing a similar length journey, always seemed a world away; a destination requiring planning and a large amount of free time.

There is also the small matter that, until recently, the Constitution State did not have much to offer somebody with my interests. However, over the past few years, Connecticut has turned into somewhat of an anomaly for a northeastern state. While Massachusetts and our northern counterparts wait with folded arms and rolling eyes for all red tape to be cut in the planning and building of skateparks - only to be disappointed time and time again with the end results -countless concrete skateparks of exceptional quality have sprung up below our southern boundary like fungi after a week of rain. The state has thus solidified its position as the skatepark capital of the region, and if a map were to be drawn highlighting the frequency of such arenas, one would not be blamed for likening Connecticut’s flat suburban sprawl to a small-scale Oregon or Washington. Accordingly, mountain people like myself have gradually begun to chop away at the mental block protruding into the path of an easy day trip to this strange land where liquor stores remain closed on Sundays but passengers can drink in the car. Last Wednesday myself and three others piled into my Scion xB, the vessel for countless trips of a similar nature over the course of the past 9 years, and made a beeline for Connecticut.

Stop 1: Willimantic

Take a poll of northerners’ favorite park in Connecticut and the overwhelming majority will cite Willimantic. Even were it nestled amongst its Cascading cousins, the park would hold its own. Unfortunately, in addition to being known for its seamless flow and abundant lines, the park is renowned for its unpleasant clientele. It’s not that the locals are especially salty or intimidating, but rather the place acts like a bug lamp shown upon swarms of scooters and bikes. Not to downplay one’s activity of choice, but I have a hard time discerning which is worse, the possibility of being made into a splat on the concrete by a 30 pound hunk of metal weighed down by an exponentially heavier operator, or that of steamrolling a small child oblivious to his surroundings. Taking these setbacks into consideration, we headed directly to Willimantic in hope of squeezing in a couple hours of stress free skating before the onset of pandemonium. 

To our disbelief, as we rounded the final corner into the tucked away grove of trees sheltering the park, we found ourselves alone save for a few town workers tending to various duties around the property.  

The park is laid out in such a way that given the opportunity, one can ride it in a circle, making endless laps without pushing until one’s desires are fulfilled or their legs give out. Of course, considering the usual population density, this is rarely an option. On this particular morning it was as if our suspicions were confirmed: given the opportunity to skate it with only one’s friends, Willimantic is indeed as fun as it looks. Our smiles were unmistakable even from opposite corners of the park. Fearful of jinxing our good fortune, we all fought a losing battle against our compulsion to express our satisfaction. Though our 6am wake-up call had seemed excessive at the time, our efforts were now paying off tenfold. Naturally, others eventually began to flow in, and the park returned to its usual chaotic disposition, but at that point we had gotten more than our share, and were ready to move on.

Stop 2: Wethersfield 

When planning our quick jaunt down south, we knew for certain that we wanted to go to Willimantic and Bristol. Inconveniently, the two are located on opposite sides of Hartford, an hour’s drive that seemed impractical given our limited time in the area.  One can imagine our delight when an uncharacteristically agreeable local at our first stop informed us that the city of Wethersfield, conveniently located a stones throw from the capital, had just finished an extensive program of repairs to their park. Coupled with the unheard-of session we had just had, it seemed as if our luck were too good to be true. Smiles still stretched across our faces, we counted our blessings and made westbound haste.

The reason Wethersfield had not been considered an option, despite our knowledge of its existence, was that until recently the majority of the park was unskateable. In the several years between its conception and current state, a birth mark of water-damaged concrete, a mere freckle assumed benign by those with the money to repair it, had spread like melanoma, consuming every morsel of flatbottom and forcing even the most optimistic user to maneuver along the perimeter like a child avoiding “hot lava” tiles on a linoleum floor. To ride across the spoiled parts would mean an immediate loss of one’s speed; to fall on said surface would mean an immediate loss of one’s skin. Fortunately, the town opted not to let the space decay completely (as municipalities so often do), but arranged for extensive concrete chemotherapy, restoring the park to its former health.

One of the first projects by Breaking Grounds, a now defunct but fondly remembered skatepark construction company from the region, Wethersfield doesn’t cover a large area, but consists of a few fun lines. There is a perimeter option with a euro gap, ledge, and a few pump bumps to keep things moving, a realistically tight pool with a not so realistic open side allowing for entry and exit from the rest of the park, and a main section consisting of a pyramid, a couple corners, a bank to ledge and a few other harder to categorize obstacles. This final area can only safely support one user at a time, which becomes troublesome when a crowd begins to gather.  Apparently we weren’t the only ones who had heard of Wethersfield’s resurrection, and after only a short while we were compelled to move along, having broken the drive up nicely.

Stop 3: Bristol

The final item on our post-it length agenda is an odd duck in the pond of northeastern skateparks. A primarily transition-centric region, New England is in fact home to the occasional skate plaza. Amongst these white whales Bristol reigns Moby Dick. Its expanses allow for fun to be had (for the more street inclined) even during a mid-afternoon frenzy of scooters and bikes. While there is a pool complete with tile and an oddly placed deathbox (in the shallow end), the fanbase consists largely of those more willing to throw themselves down stairs than scratch a piece of pool coping. With transition aplenty elsewhere, the pool is certainly not the park’s claim to fame.

Though I’m unable to speak the minds of all in attendance, I always find parks like Bristol to be a breath of fresh air. Though I don’t have much, if anything, to offer in terms of flip tricks and things of the like, I find great satisfaction in seeking out lines that even somebody with my aptitude and motivation can enjoy. With several manual pad and low ledge options, Bristol caters nicely to my cohort.

In the grand scheme of what the state has to offer, we barely scratched the surface with our three stops. Then again, there is only so much one can physically skate in one day, and having arrived at our first stop just after 9am, I see no danger is saying that we made the most of our journey. A stop at Buffalo Wild Wings killed any motivation we may have had to venture somewhere else on the way home, which was probably for the best.  There are tons more parks that I hope to get to soon, including a couple promising locations in the southwest corner of the state, just shy of New York. If all goes as planned, I will have more to share from the “Pacific Northeast” soon.
