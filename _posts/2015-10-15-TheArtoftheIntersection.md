Museums chronicling national history, especially in countries striving to promote (or cover up) certain legacies, can prove difficult to read and often serve as examples of a most deliberate curation of the facts.  Sure, even institutions with a blatantly biased perception of past events provide their own brand of insight, but must be balanced with subjective, if not opposing viewpoints to provide a clear picture of a country.  Contemporary art museums, on the other hand, favor the critic. I don’t mean the critic of contemporary art, but rather the critical artist, who uses their medium to project a less savory depiction of events than those in power might appreciate.  Dissent is more difficult to filter when masked in beauty, and even in the most patriotic institutions art can whisper state secrets to those keen on listening.

It is for this reason that I always enjoy visiting contemporary art museums wherever I travel. One crisp fall afternoon, after a disconcertingly fast-paced mandatory tour of the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle, I ventured just outside the city center to a utilitarian building perched atop a hill overlooking the river Vardar and downtown Skopje.  Inside the Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art (Музеј на Современата Уметност), I found the peace and opportunity for introspection that I often seek out in museums.  I find this tranquility particularly effective in relieving the stress of being in a foreign land for an extended period of time.  Intending on losing myself amidst some of the region’s finest artwork, I was blindsided by the unexpected yet wholly welcome opportunity to learn a skill that would enhance my ability to function in many places around the world.

Language barriers are always one of the first concerns people identify when considering foreign travel.  I am very quick to offer the idea that there is no transaction necessary to human life that cannot be carried out through a combination of pointing fingers, sign language, and a friendly smile.  Yet, It is also true that one can more easily enjoy themselves if they’ve got a grasp on the local language.  Often overlooked in these discussions, however, is the issue of non-latin alphabets.  While an American can travel to much of the world and at least sound out the words presented on signs, menus, and the like, this luxury becomes non-existent in places like Macedonia where they use Cyrillic text.  What makes this newfound illiteracy even more frustrating is the visual resemblance between many characters in the Cyrillic and Roman alphabets despite their entirely different sounds.  In Cyrillic, the letter resembling “H” is not what it seems, nor are the ones that look like “P”, “C”, and “B”.  Without the aid of local knowledge, it can often be very intimidating to step foot into an establishment having no idea how to even pronounce its name.

Unfortunately, many people don’t have the time to learn a new alphabet before visiting a new country.  I had the time, but didn’t bother, which is more likely the case for most travelers.  Luckily for me, I like contemporary art, and found myself experiencing a profound breakthrough in the galleries of the Macedonian Museum.  For the sake of foreign visitors, the labels in the museum are presented first in Macedonian, then in English (nice of them, I know).  Though perhaps not their intent, this juxtaposition presents the opportunity for comparison between alphabetic characters. And so, on that afternoon, I found myself overwhelmed with emotions that I had not felt since early in my childhood, sounding out words and receiving confirmation that I was reading them correctly.  Had I not worked in contemporary art museums and witnessed first-hand the struggle they endure to demolish stereotypes surrounding their contents and visitors, I may not have been quick to notice the merits of a non-art-related educational experience taking place in an art museum. The value of this visit can be measured on four different levels:

###Appreciation:  

Aside from the alphabetic learning that took place, I do feel compelled to note that the museum housed quite an impressive and enjoyable collection of art, and for those so inclined, would be worth visiting for that reason alone. 

###Understanding: 

When I left the museum it was as if a layer in the veil separating me and the region had been peeled away.  I was seeing things in a completely different light, and though being able to read is only the first in a 2 step process of translation, I was now able to recognize certain words that I had already learned to speak, and began to rapidly add new terms to my repertoire. 

###Reflection: 

I experienced memories and their associated emotions that I had long forgotten. How many of us can easily conjure memories of learning to read? I certainly could not, but when I began to sound out the names of artists in that museum, the memory of sitting with a parent, both of us swelling with pride and excitement as I sounded out words correctly, came back as vividly as if it had happened the day before. This deepened my appreciation for the institution and the material at hand.

###Motivation: 

For the rest of my time in countries utilizing the Cyrillic alphabet, I challenged myself to read anything and everything I could in the local language.  I woke each morning excited to enter establishments that used only Cyrillic script.  This ability made me feel closer to the places I was in and gave me the sense that I was getting an authentic experience.  I wanted to keep this experience going, and each day felt motivated to step further and further outside of my comfort zone. Almost four months into the trip, this was magical in thwarting off potential travel burnout.

This experience illustrates the potential for teaching through the identification of intersections between subjects. I went into the museum hoping to find peace and quiet, see some cool art, and maybe get a less glossy idea of what it’s like to be Macedonian, but left being able to experience the country (and much of the region) on a deeper level. I gained a life skill and a base upon which to build a lingual proficiency; something one might not expect from an art museum.

This phenomenon is not limited to language learning - or museums for that matter.  If you can find the intersection between what you want to teach and the interests of the audience you want to engage, you can get anyone excited about anything. It is, of course, easier said than done, but there are countless exhibits out there to prove it. This concept sits at the pinnacle of what I strive to achieve in writing about traveling and skateboarding.  There are countless points where stories related to skateboarding overlap other areas, and I hope that I can use these intersections to gain interest along both sides of the fence.

Much of what drove me to base my trip loosely around skateboarding is the entry point that it provides me into cultures in which I am very much a foreigner.  When I meet a person through skateboarding, wherever I may be, the activity serves as the intersection.  From there I am able to learn about what life is like for that person in their home country, and in turn give them a greater understanding of life in America.  In the case of the Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art, the intersection was the art itself.  Through my interest in the works in the galleries, I was able to pick up a bit of cultural competency that allowed me to better understand the culture from which the art was coming.  Imagine now, an exhibit in America showcasing Macedonian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, or Russian artists, with labels written both in English and the artist’s native tongue (and alphabet).  Visitors could then experience what I felt that afternoon in Skopje, and may even feel compelled to further investigate a language or culture. Spelled out, that means the achievement of the coveted and highly sought after phenomenon of continued engagement, which many would cite is one of the ultimate goals of any museum.
