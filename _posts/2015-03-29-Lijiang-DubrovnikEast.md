Ancient cities untouched by the culture crushing hand of tourism are hard to come by these days. I found evidence of this in the "Pearl of the Adriatic", Dubrovnik, and most recently came face to face with it once again Lijiang, China. Situated along the historic "Tea Horse Road" running through the southwestern part of the country, the city sits at the convergence of the Qinghai-Tibet and Yunnan-Guizhou plateaus, 7,900 feet above sea level. Since I left home last August, I have been forced to come to terms with the fact that my taste in destinations, though perhaps not entirely mainstream, is far from unique. Chances are, if I think a place looks cool, I'm not the only one. Lijiang was no exception.

Like Dubrovnik, The city revolves around a UNESCO ordained "old town", composed of a small portion of original architecture and a much larger portion of refurbished and recreated buildings. Like Dubrovnik, the old town is flooded with gift shops and hordes of tourists during the day, and is crawling with restaurant and bar goers at night. Yet like Dubrovnik, the idyllic beauty of the town and surrounding area cannot be denied, and is enough to make the journey there worthwhile regardless of its downfalls.

Unlike Dubrovnik however, most of the tourists flocking to Lijiang are nationals, meaning that a western face still sticks out from the crowd. This can be received in one of two ways. First, one might conclude that even though the city caters to a non-local crowd, it is still quite foreign to western visitors. English is spoken only slightly more fluently here than in Yunnan's capital, Kunming, which only means that people can say more than just "hello". Thus, though the experience Lijiang provides might not always be traditional, it is still far different than anything one might find in the Western Hemisphere. The second possible interpretation is slightly more pessimistic. One might conclude that if a place is going to be watered down, it might as well go all the way and lend itself to an international crowd. I prefer the former of the two rationales, as I like to believe there is value in seeing the way in which  tourism functions outside the realm of what I am used to back home.  Furthermore, it is important to note that the west does not have a monopoly on modernity, and while it is always heart wrenching to see culture turned into commodity, it would be unfair to expect a region to forgo the socioeconomic benefits of a consistent cash flow for the sake of providing me with an untainted experience. Lijiang may not be the same city it was 500 - or even 5 - years ago, but it will be many years before its value is entirely lost.
