In the United States, people often talk about privilege. Most commonly, discussions focus around "white privilege" or "male privilege", because those are at the forefront of the issues facing the country.  Stepping outside of the US, it becomes obvious that being American is itself a privilege. This is not a profound statement by any means.  This is something that I recall being told time and time again throughout my life, and I knew it to be true long before I began my journey.  It is the basis of the "there are children starving in Africa" argument used by parents to get their kids to finish their broccoli. However, I did not fully understand the gravity of this privilege until I traveled to the Balkans.  On paper, the difference between knowing something and understanding it is largely a matter of letters and syllables, but in reality the difference is that between being told something and seeing it first hand.  While the former can greatly influence the way one chooses to navigate the world, the latter has the most personal and long-lasting effect. There is no way to do justice to this distinction on paper. 

I recently wrote about the guilt I felt in liking Serbia.  The people I met there were very nice, the cities were interesting, and I enjoyed my time in the country immensely.  Two days after I left Belgrade, a drone carrying a flag depicting "Greater Albania" was flown into the city's Partizan Stadium during a match between the Serbian and Albanian national soccer teams.  Pandemonium ensued, and the game was called off after only 41 minutes.  Confrontations between players were punctuated by fans pelting the Albanian team with debris from the stands.  I suspect the chaos would have been even greater had the authorities not barred anyone with a Kosovo passport from entering the stadium.  That's right, at a European sporting event in the 21st century, people of a certain nationality were not allowed to enter the stadium.

I found it difficult to comprehend how this could happen in the city I had just found so agreeable. I wanted to give both sides the benefit of the doubt - so I did. My life resumed as normal. A few days later I traveled to Prishtinë.

Kosovo's capital is the youngest in Europe both in terms of formal recognition and the age of its citizens, about 50 percent of whom are under 25. It is an energetic city, where people dress to impress, keeping everything about their appearances well-groomed. It is a city in which I'm told 80 percent of the population can speak 4 or 5 languages, but 40 percent are unemployed. The only businesses that appear to never be empty are barber shops, jewelry stores, and cafes. The population is one that, after years of being the minority, has finally earned its chance to thrive, only to be plagued by political disfunction.  In spending time in the city and speaking with the people who live there, the desire to move past the conflicts that have held them back for so long becomes quite clear. It is not difficult to see that the people of Prishtinë are ready and willing; the only thing missing is opportunity. Feelings toward Serbia are strong, negative, and justified. Anti-Serb sentiments are present everywhere one turns.  I like Prishtinë a lot. The people I have met here are welcoming, intelligent, and pleasant to be around. Yet, I look back on the time I spent in Serbia and still want to give both countries the benefit of the doubt - so I do.

My time in the Balkans, Serbia and Kosovo in particular, has brought to light what I believe to be the pinnacle of American privilege: that I have the option of giving people the benefit of the doubt. I don't have to be a cynic. I can say "not all Serbs" and I'll be right, but my opinions would be far different if the conflict between the two countries affected me like it does the people of Kosovo. When I leave the Balkans I will no longer be face to face with the issues that linger there.  Even as a traveler I have the privilege of viewing these issues from a third party perspective.  I can say "forgive and forget" or "be the bigger man", but nobody is checking my passport when I go to a sporting event.
