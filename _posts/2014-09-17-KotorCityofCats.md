A few weeks ago I wrote about the surprisingly large population of stray dogs in Sarajevo.  It would appear that in this regard, the Bosnian capital has a foil in the city of Kotor, Montenegro.  While Sarajevo's canine population reigns supreme amongst the city's feral animal population, their feline counterparts preside over Kotor.  Countless cats of all shapes, sizes, and colors make their homes on the narrow streets of the old town, and while the human residents of Sarajevo acknowledge the dogs' presence with respectful indifference, the cats of Kotor are regarded with honor and endearment.  It is not uncommon to see one such animal curled up alongside a smitten tourist while they eat their surprisingly expensive seafood dinner. The cats pose for photographs, are featured on T-Shirts, and are immortalized in the city's own "Cats Museum."  The two-room institution displays only a fraction of its collection of historically significant cat-related ephemera, and does so in a way that is both informative and engaging.  Though I was unable to uncover an answer as to why the city has such an affinity for the creatures, I was able to capture several photos of the cats in their natural habitat. Enjoy.
