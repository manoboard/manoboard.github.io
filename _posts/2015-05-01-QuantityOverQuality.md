As you may already be aware, I arrived back in the United States a couple of weeks ago after some of the best times of my life traveling and skateboarding around the world. It was a bittersweet return, a relief in many ways, but the onset of a whole new set of worries as well. I spent my first week on US soil in Seattle, and one of my first stops was Judkins park, perhaps still my favorite skatepark in the entire world. For those who have been there, you know that it's not the largest or most demanding park in Seattle, but for those who have not, allow me to explain. According to Grindline's (the company that built it) website, the Judkins park skatepark covers 10,000 square feet. Though they don't give specifics on ramp size, I'll estimate that the largest feature in it measures in somewhere around 8 feet tall, and the next highest below that right around 6. The park is not gargantuan by any means, but as any skateboarder knows, the size of the skatepark is not what makes it fun. It is the layout, in turn, that keeps the stoke high. Unfortunately, skateboarders aren't always the first people consulted in the design of a skatepark. I was reminded of this on the final leg of my trip, while traveling in China.

China is home to the two biggest skateparks in the world, located in Guangzhou and Shanghai respectively. China however, is not home to the two *best* skateparks in the world, an equation that doesn't quite add up given the time and money put into the two facilities. This disconnect is the perfect metaphor for how China approaches many subjects, not simply skateboarding. At the risk of generalization, China seems to value quantitative metrics over qualitative ones. Whether it's the most populous cities, the fastest growing economy, or the world's biggest skateparks, China's self-worth is measured in numbers rather than through more liberal criteria. This may work in many fields, but with skateboarding it will never fit. The vast majority of skateboard culture is based around value that can't be adequately described in figures or charts. I'm talking about style. I'm talking about creativity. I'm talking about why the 10,000 square foot Judkins skatepark is better than the nearly 150,000 square foot park in Shanghai or the 182,000 square foot one in Guangzhou.

China does not look at things this way. The mentality of those in charge seems to be "our parks are the biggest in the world, so of course they're the best", but in the realm of skateboarding it's rarely the superlatives that gain the most acclaim. Though I haven't conducted any research into the matter, I feel comfortable saying that few skateboarders would cite Ryan Sheckler or Nyjah Huston as their favorite skaters - or furthermore as the "best". Yet on paper, their earnings, fame, and competition results suggest otherwise. Like China's skateparks, they have the numbers to suggest their superiority, but lack the criteria to make them favorites amongst the community.

The construction and layout of the recently opened Guangzhou park support this hypothesis. The park may contain elements found in great skateparks, but the physical setup makes some of the larger features not only impractical and unattractive to skateboarders, but in some cases dangerous as well. Even the construction of some of the safer elements of the park hints at a general lack of adherence to the best practices of skatepark construction. The coping around the park is of a lightweight variety, meaning that grinds stick easily if not perfectly balanced. The inconsistency of the panels used to construct the Masonite bowls further suggests a certain level of misunderstanding. Unfortunately, this all implies that the primary objective was to build the biggest park without spending the most money. Cheap materials and construction can ruin a park even if its design is sound.

In the case of Shanghai, the quality and functionality of the park are not in question. Clearly the builder knew what they were doing. The trouble with the park is that the vast majority of its features can only be utilized by a microscopic percentage of users. When the park was built, it was the biggest on earth (and remained so until Guangzhou opened this year), and it seems likely that they wanted the grandeur of the park to fall in line with its square footage. Accordingly, a 100 foot wide, 13 foot tall (at its smallest point) vert ramp, complete with an unprecedented 20 foot roll-in, sits virtually unused on one side. Additionally, the 20 foot full pipe and surrounding bowl with 15 foot deep end are left to decay while crowds build in the sections with more reasonably sized features. This is not to say the larger portions of the park never get used. For demos and the occasional visiting professional, they are likely to yield some sensational spectating for bystanders, but for the average skatepark visitor, they are of little use. It would appear that those who built the park were not concerned with the average user. They built a park for the "best" skateboarders, bikers, and bladers, which in the statistical sense, refers to those who are able to make use of the largest features. 

Before I dig myself too deep a hole here and end up blacklisted, I must admit that I had a really great time at both skateparks - Shanghai especially. All the benches, curbs, stairs, and manny pads around the park's perimeter offer endless opportunities to get creative. There is something amiss however, when more people skate a two foot tall quarterpipe in a far corner than the six bowls immediately available upon entry. Shanghai's park is a lot of fun, just not in the way they intended, which for a park of that scale is somewhat disappointing. I should also point out that this is not simply a Chinese phenomenon. There are parks everywhere that miss the mark, but in China the shortcomings seem to fall in line with the desire to fulfill certain quantitative criteria rather than focusing efforts on the infinitely more important qualitative ones.
