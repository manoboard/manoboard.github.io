It has been a while since my last shave. Like, four months. What started as laziness turned into a sort of game, in which I challenged myself to let my facial hair grow just a little bit longer. I suspect this is a game that most males play at some point in their lives. I have now grown rather attached to that which is attached to me, and though I have done a little pruning, my beard has been allowed to flourish. An unexpected side effect of my appearance, I have found areas with large Muslim populations quite welcoming to a perceived follower. On numerous occasions, I have gotten nods of what I interpret as solidarity from Muslim men, and one even went so far as to call me "brother". Unfortunately, this is only beneficial in surface level encounters. Once the mistaken party has been informed that I am in fact just a scruffy American on holiday, their tone of tends to shift to one of confusion. Luckily, it has yet to turn to anger, and my misleading appearance caused me no trouble for the first nine countries of my trip.

As mentioned in earlier posts, I have grown accustomed to making sure my travel between destinations remains as stress free as possible. I knew that the border between Bulgaria and Turkey, the last stop on the first half of my world tour, might be a little more time and energy consuming than other border crossings in the regions.  Accordingly, I took every measure I could to ensure my ease of passage and peace of mind.  Thus, when I exited the bus to go through customs, I was thrilled to be waved on after simply handing my passport and visa to the guard in the booth. Tickled by my excellent preparation, I felt a weight relinquish from my shoulders as I waited in Turkey for others to sort out their visa issues. 

To pass the time, a Turkish man around my age and I began conversing. Our chat consisted of the usual stuff: "Where are you from?", "Is this your first time in Turkey?" - nothing groundbreaking. Before we could get into more meaningful discussion, we were joined by two more men, one tall, middle aged, and round; the other short, lean, and in the prime of his life. They were a Turkish odd couple of sorts. The men began speaking with my acquaintance, motioning toward me every once in a while, and eventually the younger of the two looked at me and said enthusiastically,

"Welcome to Turkey. Nice beard."

I thanked him for his hospitality and compliment, and before I knew it I was engaged in the same sort of standard small talk as I had been just moments earlier. I am relatively used to these types of interactions with curious strangers, so this did not feel at all out of the ordinary. Similarly, I am used to being on my guard in such situations, and instinctively provide vague answers to thwart any unwanted business transactions.

"How long will you stay in Turkey?"

"Oh I don't know, maybe like five days."

The question quickly came up about my religion, which again, is nothing new. Par for the course, the man seemed surprised to hear that I was not a Muslim, and I felt a little as if I had been caught in some act of deception. He began asking more questions about where I was staying, and if I planned to go anywhere outside of Istanbul. Fearing the offer of accommodations, I prepared to excuse myself, but before I could he asked,

"And maybe you will go to Syria or Iraq? Maybe Lebanon?"

Not wanting to insult a native of the region, I opted again for the noncommittal route.

"Nah, maybe next time."

In retrospect, I should have picked up on the nature of our interaction far sooner than I did. The man glanced toward the customs booth where I had left my passport, and I followed suit. I should not have been surprised to see his companion inside, talking to the officer and looking back at us periodically. Finally in tune with what was transpiring, I began to backpedal.

"Well, I mean, probably not anytime soon, though", I joked.

From that point on I was straightforward with my answers. I made it clear to the plain-clothed border guard that I would not be leaving the city, let alone the country, and that I already had my departure flight booked. Shortly I was sent on my way, another lesson learned.

There is nothing underwhelming about the city of Istanbul. The crowds, traffic, flavors, smells, architecture - you name it - are all set to a few decibels higher than in other cities. Istanbul is a city in which superlatives seem warranted, whether it's the biggest, the oldest, the best, or any other word ending in "est". If one were to place any of Istanbul's mosques - even one of the smaller, less famous ones - in any other city, that city would then become a major tourist destination.  When looking out over the Bosporus straight, the dense urban landscape, thousands of years in the making, stretches as far as the eye can see.

Unfortunately, the sheer amount of people, tourists and locals alike, means that one must be more careful here than anywhere else I have yet traveled to. Within an hour of my arrival, I fell victim to a common taxi scam. Though frustrating, this served as a good reality check, and a wake up call reminding me that I was no longer in the Balkans. Similarly, at every door waits a restaurant host or merchant exclaiming "hello, my friend" in an attempt to lure your inside. Some even begin their solicitation with "yes, please" as if there was never any question as to whether or not a sale was going to be made. Outside the main tourist areas the transactions are a little friendlier. In these places the attitude is more along the lines of "here is what I have, would you like to buy it?" as opposed to "you need this, why haven't you paid me yet?" 

Istanbul can be exhausting.

Despite the inevitable sensory overload, it truly is a magical place. I have managed to eat meat cut off a spit for at least two meals a day since my arrival, and have no complaints on the subject. After adjusting to the somewhat cutthroat atmosphere of the city, it is easy to see why everyone who travels to Istanbul loves it. It is a place unlike any I have ever been to. Additionally, the cities on the second half of my trip appear to be far more "Istanbul" than "Sarajevo", so I am thankful to have this introduction to the overwhelming pace of life that awaits me.
