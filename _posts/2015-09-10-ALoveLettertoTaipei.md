Whenever posed the question as to my favorite place from my travels, I make no haste in citing Taiwan - Taipei specifically - as the unwavering winner.  I have, however, refrained from writing these sentiments in the more concrete and accountable ledgers of this blog. My hesitation has not been due to uncertainty, though. No, I am quite sure that Taipei is my favorite place I have ever visited.  My restraint comes as a result of an inability to accurately describe what it is I find so heavenly about the city; my need to paint a picture so acute in its illustration of my sentiments that anything less than 100 percent accurate simply would not do.  I have also balked in the vetting of my love for fear of glossing over the Taipei that I did not experience; that is, the Taipei known only to those who call the city home.  It is for this reason that I make the distinction that Taipei is an incredible place to *visit*. I don’t know what it’s like to live there. For locals, the country faces a number of problems that somebody like myself would never even begin to uncover in a month of vacationing. Thus, the ardor with which I view the Taiwanese capital is much akin to the naive esteem in which citizens of many countries around the world hold the United States. Of course, this begs the question, if it’s not a utopia, what is it that’s so intoxicating about Taipei?

Physically, the city lacks the shock of places like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Absent are the sun hats, roadside cauldrons of soup, and tangles of electrical wires strung like a canopy from building to building. Conversely, Taipei does not exude the grandeur of cities like Hong Kong and Shanghai, whose skyscrapers radiate an ultramodern aura that has become the Getty image for 21st century Asia. The city’s only true skyscraper, Taipei 101, though quite tall in its own right, stands alone amidst a sea of medium-large rectangular buildings.  One cannot really speak of the Taipei skyline, because it simply does not exist.  Likewise, though a handful of the temples that one might assume exist in lieu of such futuristic architecture can be found around the city, even those are more sparse than in other places in the region.  And while streets are illuminated with neon signs and shop windows adorned with roasted poultry, the dazzle of Taipei’s nightlife surely exists on a smaller scale than say, Tokyo. In this sense, Taipei for me is a veritable third bowl of porridge. As a visitor, one does not necessarily feel at home in Taipei, but not entirely out of place either. Once described to me as a city embodying the best qualities of Japan and China, the Taiwanese capital’s fine balance of homelike hospitality and striking foreignness make it feel *just right*.
