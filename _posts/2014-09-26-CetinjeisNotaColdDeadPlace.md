Popular news and culture outlet, Vice, recently put out a series of videos chronicling a notorious gang of European jewel thieves known as the Pink Panthers.  In their coverage of the group, Vice sent a correspondent and crew to Cetinje, Montenegro, where the Panthers are said to have originated.  In between mispronunciations of the name of the city, Vice did everything in their power to project Cetinje as a Stalinist wasteland in which the sun never shines; the perfect setting for a thrilling tale of the world's most Russo-centric heist aficionados.  

In the midst of attempting to make a cohort of low-brow thugs seem like an elite faction of criminal masterminds, Vice failed to mention the fact that Cetinje, the old royal capital, is arguably the most historic city in the country.  It is also home to several impressive cultural and religious institutions, such as the National History Museum of Montenegro, National Art Museum of Montenegro, the Dado Duric Contemporary Art Gallery, and the Cetinje Monastery.

Historical and cultural significance aside, the town is built around a pedestrian-only promenade lined with restaurants and cafes interspersed between former embassies and historical buildings.  All this is tucked in the mountains within spitting distance of two National Parks and the Adriatic Sea.  Simply put, it rules.

Herein lies the problem with travel-related journalism.  The two most effective ways to craft a story that people not already interested in an area will read are: A) talk about how crazy and backwards the place is, or B) talk about how beautiful and misunderstood the place is.  Either way, the reader isn't getting the whole story.  

In reality, as far as I know, Vice's coverage only contained a couple of factual inaccuracies (the mispronunciation of the city's name, and the unemployment statistic, which was not even close to correct).  The country, which sided with Serbia during the ever popular Balkan war of the 1990s did indeed suffer greatly from western sanctions despite the fact that no fighting took place on Montenegrin soil. Accordingly, many of Montenegro's citizens are not the most financially stable.  Yet, the problem with only reporting the economic and criminal woes of the country is that it is only half the story.  When a person in America who knows nothing of the place sits down to watch Vice's story, they form a mental picture of Montenegro as a hotbed for crime set in a cold and distant land where danger lurks around every corner.

On the other hand, travel writers, in the interest of selling their books or increasing website traffic, are often the purveyors of a glossed over image of the issues plaguing certain locales.  There is also a certain amount of ego stroking that comes into play when the proud world traveler tells riveting tales of exotic lands with beautiful and hospitable locals. In such articles, they use the word "humbling" too often, and go into great detail about the virtues of their work. They urge readers to quit their jobs and move to Bali, conveniently omitting the fact that such an option is only viable to a small portion of the world's population. They're the kind of people who only wear wool socks, and eat stir-fried vegetables for dinner every night.

I'm not saying I have all the answers. That would make me one of the people I was just making fun of (though I only own one pair of wool socks). However, I roll my eyes every time I encounter a piece that takes either of these approaches.  If one focuses exclusively on the ways in which a place is different than their home, they are only getting half the benefit of travel.  For every 1 difference between home and away, there are 10 similarities, and it is in acknowledging both that we can fully appreciate the positive impact of visiting new places.
