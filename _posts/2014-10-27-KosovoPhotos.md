It appears as if heat (amongst other things) is a commodity in Kosovo. The seasons have jumped unexpectedly from summer to winter, and I can see my breath in my hostel room. Instead of risking frostbite by having my fingers out from beneath a blanket for too long, I've decided to forego the usual rumination this week. Luckily, I've taken a bunch of photos over the course of the last week and a half in this beautiful and intriguing country, and they're just dying to be shared. Enjoy!

This is about as close to a panoramic view as I could find in Kosovo's capital, Prishtinë.

Some "unique" architecture makes up the library of the University of Prishtinë.

This was the closest I came to finding a skate shop in Kosovo.

Looked out my window one morning and this is what I saw.

I spent the last portion of my stay in Kosovo in the country's second largest city, Prizren.

The view from the Prizren Fortress sure isn't bad.

Neither is the view from halfway there.
