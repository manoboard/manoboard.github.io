Skateboarding and music have always gone hand in hand. The pairing is only fitting given that the two mediums share several core values: individuality, creativity, self-expression, *style*. Accordingly, the interaction between the two often goes far beyond mere cultural similarities.  For proof of this, one need not look further than the overwhelming presence of Dinosaur Jr-related material that contributed immensely to the mise en scéne of Alien Workshop’s 2009 video, *Mindfield*.  The four tracks and numerous appearances by frontman, J Mascis, served as a celebration of the long-standing relationship between the brand and the band.

One might also point to the large number of skateboarders who end up making a living creating music once their skating careers are over.  Amongst the more well known examples is Tommy Guerrero, who has maintained a legacy within the realm of skateboarding history while achieving a great deal of success in his music.  Similarly, the laid back, quintessentially “SoCal” melodies of Matt Costa come as a result of a knee injury that ended the singer/songwriter’s professional skateboarding career.  For the sake of argument, one could even mention that Chad Muska branched out into the world of artistic sound-making with *Muskabeats*; though they would be hard pressed to argue that anyone took him seriously.  Even more commonplace are skateboarders who experience a limited degree of recognition in music as a result of their acclaim on a board.  Skaters like Tony Trujillo, Justin Figueroa, and Thrasher Magazine editor Jake Phelps have all been seen playing sets while on tour. The ability to live out of a van on a low budget alongside a gaggle of smelly dudes undoubtedly lends itself nicely to this crossover.

Conversely, it is far more common for those who make their living as musicians to be avid skateboarders once they step outside the studio.  Aside from the aforementioned Mascis, Grandaddy’s Jason Lytle has always been recognized by skateboarders as one of their own; his passion for the activity made apparent in songs like “Skateboarding Saves Me Twice”. In hip-hop, Tyler the Creator and Odd Future are known for their association with the shop/brand, Supreme, and few are unaware of Lil Wayne’s affinity for the activity. With the founding of 1939 Skateboards, a company whose decks feature art pertaining to metal bands with single word names like Sleep and Witch, the connection between skateboarding and music is now visible on the walls of skateshops around the world. Punk legend, Ian Mackaye, of Minor Threat, Fugazi, et al, is an outspoken advocate of skateboarding, and too shares a mutual respect with the community. So adamant about the virtues of skateboarding is Mackaye, that his opinions on the subject have been cited in interviews with a number of esteemed institutions.

Though the similarities between the skateboarding and music worlds are readily accepted and talked about, it is less common that people examine what one culture can teach us about the other.  Aside from comparisons to punk rock, which tend to hone in specifically on DIY ethic or the struggle between skateboarders and law enforcement, absent is the academic examination of skateboarding that music is so commonly subject to.  Given the overlap, it seems logical that some of the theories used to understand music as a sociological phenomenon could be directly applied to skateboarding culture.  With the rising popularity of skateboarding as a subject of study, such a lens has the potential to help interested parties from outside the community achieve a greater understanding of how the skateboarding world functions.

Perhaps surprisingly however, it is not punk rock or heavy metal, nor is it hip-hop that has the most to offer in terms of a comparative culture. Given the physical presence of these genres in the skateboarding world, these would constitute valid assumptions. However, in terms of social structure, it is in fact Jazz with which skateboarding has the most in common.

###The Jazz Impulse

What is it that makes John Coltrane a legendary Jazz musician? Miles Davis? Duke Ellington? Is it their mastery of their craft; their superior wielding of their instrument? What is it that endows Mark Gonzalez with a similar stature in the skateboarding community? Tom Penny? Andrew Reynolds? Did they (and do they continue to) manipulate the plies beneath their feet better than all others? The answer to all the questions is yes and no.

In his book, *A Change is Gonna Come: Music, Race & the Soul of America*, author Craig Warner (2006) eloquently projects what those in the know have been saying for years. 

> “…the histories of jazz too often confuse finding a voice with technical skill, being able to play high like Louis, fast like Bird, dense like Trane.  But at the very most, technique’s only half the story.  Finding your own voice, in the black jazz tradition, demands knowing where that voice comes from, confronting, without illusion or evasion, who you really are.” (p. 134)

The same, of course, can be said of skateboarding.

To fully comprehend the ways in which Jazz can educate the public about skateboarding culture, it is necessary to differentiate between the concepts of genre and what Werner describes as *impulse*.  While genre describes a sect within the music world based largely on sound and/or message, impulse focuses more heavily on implicit functions of the composition such as feeling. Thus, impulse often spans the boundaries of genre, offering greater insight into more about the work’s place within the overarching realm of music.  For instance, a rap song may embody the jazz Impulse despite it’s foundations outside the latter genre. In his book, Werner (2006) builds upon an explanation laid down by author Ralph Ellison to define parameters for his theory.  

> “The jazz artist constantly reworks her identity on three levels: (1) as an individual; (2) as a member of a community; and (3) as a ‘link in the chain of tradition’” (p. 132).

By breaking down the concept into three concrete segments, the author allows any listener to look for the jazz Impulse in any piece of music.  Unbeknownst to Werner, his assessment also proves to be a fitting analogy for the inner workings of skateboarding culture. When dismantled, it can be said confidently that skateboarding is inherently a jazz impulse activity. These three means through which identity is sculpted have the ability to provide insight into why certain things become popular within the skateboard community, or why certain skaters go unnoticed despite superior technical ability. The jazz impulse can explain why skateboarders don’t all cite Rodney Mullen as their biggest influence, despite the sheer number of tricks he “invented”, or why certain brands are destined to fail.  It can provide clarity in otherwise opaque terminology such as “core” “real” and “authentic”.  Regardless of desired nomenclature, the reading of the skateboarding tome by light of Werner’s theory can reveal volumes about an often misinterpreted culture. 

####1: The Skateboarder as an Individual

One of the most frequently lamented elements of skateboarding is the opportunity for individuality that it provides its participants.  This characteristic has been used to no end to differentiate skateboarding from traditional team-based sports.  For many, it is the function that defines skateboarding as art rather than sport.  Accordingly, this element happens to be the most straight forward.  In a world in which individuality championed, originality is paramount to relevancy.  Go to any skatepark on Earth and there are bound to be a couple kids there, dressed like everyone else, doing the same tricks as everyone else. No matter how bonafide their prowess, they will ultimately be lost in the shuffle.

####2: The Skateboarder as Part of a Community

A controversial subject, it has been said that skateboarding, at least on the professional level, is somewhat of a popularity contest.  Thus, establishing oneself as a part of the vibrant, if exclusive, skateboarding community is an essential stepping stone on the path to consideration.  But then, where are the boundaries drawn? Who is in and who is out? Who decides? While these metrics are constantly fluctuating with the tides of skateboarding’s oceanic social landscape, it can be said as a rule of thumb that exclusion can be drastically influenced by a person or entity’s presence *outside* the community.  That is to say, the “for us by us” mentality is celebrated in skateboarding. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule. The most apparent example is that while the presence of energy drink companies in just about every realm of skateboarding draws a collective sigh of frustration, an acceptance of sponsorship does not warrant immediate excommunication.  Energy drinks and other billion dollar corporations, by means of brute financial force, have found their ways into the pockets of even the most revered skaters. To fulfill this second requirement, such skaters must balance large corporate sponsorships with associations with companies whose dedication to skateboarding is undeniable. Naturally, those who fail to succumb to the temptation of a steady paycheck will always be held in higher regard than those who give in.

####3. The Skateboarder as a Link in the Chain of Tradition

The first two criteria straddle a fine line between insightful and obvious. It is the third and subsequently most important distinction however, that requires a bit closer examination.  In many ways, this final characteristic envelopes the first two, relying heavily upon the presence of individuality within the parameters of the community. Fortunately, this element is easily understood when the Jazz Impulse is applied to a real-life example.

At some point or another, much of the population, both skateboarders and otherwise, has seen freestyle skateboarder, Kilian Martin’s tricks compiled into dramatic, extravagantly produced short films.  Yet, despite the widespread viewership of each montage (his latest video, *Searching Sirocco*, has over 440,000 views on YouTube), they receive little to no attention from the skateboarding community itself.  There is no denying the extent of Martin’s technical prowess.  He possesses a board control that is second to none, and composes combinations of tricks that take a moment to wrap one’s head around.  He is certainly a very good skateboarder, and truly an “individual” as the first criteria of the jazz impulse requires.  Why is it then, that he does not get more recognition for his efforts from those who share his passion? The answer to this question lies in Martin’s nonconformity to the latter two criteria in Werner’s doctrine.

A man is measured by the company he keeps. This age-old idiom is as true here as it is elsewhere, and one’s credibility within skateboarding can be measured as such. In matters of community, Kilian Martin is lacking.  When looking at a list of sponsors, one might note the presence of Powell-Peralta, one of skateboarding’s most famous brands despite their waning influence in recent years.  Moving down the list, however, relevant connections become more difficult to find.  Similarly, when venturing to Martin’s website, one bears witness to several interviews and a great deal of praise for the skater’s hard work and excellent skills, but noticeably absent are citations from outlets from within the culture. The vast majority of accolades come from sources such as Rolling Stone Magazine, CNN, and CBS, who lack clout within the skateboarding community.  When conducting a search into the online database of Thrasher Magazine, undeniably one of the most popular skate publications on Earth, only two results bring up mention of Kilian Martin, one of which pokes fun at his alternative brand of skateboarding.

And then, what of the third requirement? What about being a “link in the chain”? One could accurately argue that Martin’s alternative style is rooted in skateboarding’s early “freestyle” movement, and is particularly reminiscent of legendary figure, Rodney Mullen.  While these statements are true, it is also fact that such a style has been absent from the limelight within the last 20 years of skateboarding’s history.  While Martin’s skating may provide a link to another era of the culture, it lacks any link to everything in between.  What good is a length of chain with only two links?

None of these things serve as evidence that Kilian Martin is not a good skateboarder, nor do they imply that he shouldn’t skate the way he does. They do however, provide some insight into why certain people, despite superior ability and sufficient levels of individuality, often go overlooked within the skateboarding community.  Just as jazz requires an individual to exhibit all three of Werner’s criteria, skateboarding too requires the complete set. Remove one link and the chain breaks. Kilian Martin’s skating is simply too far removed from the rest of the skateboarding world to grab most skaters’ attention.

As illustrated here, one of the most important components of the third criteria of the jazz impulse is reflecting upon one’s history.  Though constantly searching for unseen locations, skateboarders often return to certain spots time and time again.  Over the years, these frequently visited features gain acclaim of their own, and a certain degree of responsibility is set upon those who choose to skate them. Tracing its roots back to the overarching culture of individuality, one must have a keen knowledge of what tricks have been done at what spots lest they become victim of the “already-been-done” (ABD) faux pas.  On the other hand, when it is acknowledged that a trick has already been done at a given location, the reproduction of a maneuver can serve as an homage to the original performer.  For instance, upon notification that San Francisco’s legendary “Clipper Ledge” was slated to be torn down, Thrasher Magazine spoke with the school at which the spot was located and coordinated one last hurrah to celebrate its storied history.  During the contest, cash was not only given away for never-been-done tricks, but likewise there were incentives to perform any from a list of notable tricks that had been landed at the spot over the years.  This combination of reflection and innovation is the perfect representation of the “link in the chain” characteristic as an important component of skateboarding culture. In situations like this, it is not only allowable, but rather encouraged to perform a trick that has already been done at a spot.  However, if a skater were to do one of the ABDs outside of this format, without proper credit being given to the originator, they would undoubtedly be chastised by the community.

Apart from the similar notions of individuality, community and “link in the chain” mentality, skateboarding and jazz both champion personal freedom and self expression. In both, there are figures who so genuinely exert the implicit and explicit values of the culture in such an expert style that they begin to define what it means to be part of that community. These transcendent figures then become the totem for which each participant aspires, an embodiment of the community in its purest form.  In the world of jazz, an artist like John Coltrane fits the bill.  Just as Coltrane has been Canonized in the African Orthodox Church, were there ever a church of skate, the likeness of Mark Gonzales would undoubtedly be cast in a pane of stained glass. It is a fitting testament to the presence of the jazz impulse in skateboarding that “The Gonz" skates to Coltrane’s “Traneing In” in his fabled part in Blind’s 1991 film, *Video Days*.  The fluidity and improvisational nature of his approach to all types of skateboarding pairs perfectly with the musician’s sound.  The accuracy of the pairing is lost on few, and serves as a reminder of the deep-rooted connection between the two cultures.
