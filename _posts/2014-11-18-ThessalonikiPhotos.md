I'm far from a perfectionist, but given the opportunity to go to "every country" in a region, I have a great deal of difficulty leaving just one out. Once again, I found myself making a very short detour between points on my itinerary; this time to the capital of the ancient kingdom of Macedonia, Thessaloniki. I know what you're thinking, weren't you just in Macedonia? To much of the world, the answer would be yes, but to a Greek person the answer would be a certain no. I won't go into the details of the name dispute, but will comment that it makes traveling between the bordering nations slightly tricky.  Though a mere 30 or so kilometers from the Greek border, the city of Bitola in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, does not offer any bus or train connections into the neighboring country. Accordingly, I found myself settling into the passenger seat of a small sedan driven by a man who only spoke enough English to make it quite clear that under no circumstances was I to mention the word "taxi" at the border. Instead, if the officials asked I was to explain that we were friends - that is, friends who don't speak the same language or know anything about one another aside from first names.

No problem.

 Jovche was to drive me to the northern Greek town of Lerin, which is its name in the Macedonian language. However, once in Greece, to avoid angering locals, one must refer to the town by its Greek name, Florina. This is the case with municipalities in both countries; the Greeks have their names, and the Macedonians have their own. This requires one to constantly be on their guard when talking about where they have been and where they are going.  Luckily, I managed to avoid angering anyone on either side.  

If I were to plan my trip again, I would allot more time for Thessaloniki. It is an incredibly fast paced, crowded city where coffee shops are bordered by ancient ruins, and tradition lives in unison with modernity.  The city is packed to the brim with history, which is displayed nicely in numerous impressive museums. The food is incredible too, but that's no surprise. Many people speak English there as well, which is lucky because unlike its Cyrillic cousin, the Greek alphabet is not so easy to pick up.

All of this, of course, comes at a price. Thessaloniki was by far the most expensive location I've been to, and lacked the charm and warmth of earlier stops on my tour. However, it more than made up for its downfalls with an abundance of things to see and do. I suspect that had I spent more time there, it would have made its way into the ranks of my favorite Balkan cities.
