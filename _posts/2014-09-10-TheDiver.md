The diver leans casually, his back to the abyss, on the railing atop Stari Most, or "Old Bridge" as its name translates.  Bronzed, lanky, confident, he gazes lazily over the tops of the heads of his audience, the only acknowledgment of their presence lies in his showmanship.  He lengthens his body, stretching his arms to their fullest extent in a straight line above his head, each rib in his wiry torso visible from a distance.  Fingers jab record buttons on cameras and mobile devices, anticipating a souvenir from their two hour detour en route from Dubrovnik to Sarajevo.  The young man's body drifts backward, the speed at which it falls toward the river below increasing until, without a moment to spare, he clutches the iron crossbar, bringing his free-fall to an abrupt halt.  He pauses for a few moments, rear end extended away from the structure, the two halves of his body forming an acute angle, then pulls himself back into his initial position.

The onlookers hesitate as they begin to retract their arms, hoping that this is all part of his pre-dive ritual.  After all, they stopped at the promise of a show; an Eastern European daredevil performing a stunt undoubtedly passed down to him by his father or his grandfather, or both.  Visions of home movie night with the couples from the neighborhood are quickly extinguished as the young man swings one leg and then the other over the railing and proceeds through the crowd and out of sight.  Dumbfounded, the crowd disperses, looking for a new souvenir; perhaps a pen made from an empty bullet casing or a magnet for the fridge.

The diver is not the daredevil the crowd wants him to be.  He is a gypsy as the unimpressed townspeople say; and he is poor. Jobs are at a premium in Mostar, and if anyone is going to be given one, it will not be a gypsy.  Mostar, with its abundance of Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian architecture, is bound to get the best and worst that tourism has to offer.  With tourism comes the prostitution of culture, yet in a country with a 44.6 percent unemployment rate, it is a necessary evil.  

Several times a day the diver or one of his equivalents is positioned at the apex of the old bridge.  Often times they carry a hat with them to collect incentives from their audience.  Only when a satisfactory sum has been reached, will one take the plunge. "There used to be pride in diving," translates Teo, my host.  His father, for whom he is translating, performed the feat countless times between 1969 and 2004, his jumps and brief biography recorded in a hardcover book chronicling the yearly event that once took place in the town.  He scoffs at the theatrics now surrounding the endeavor.

Teo and his family rent rooms in their house to an ever increasing amount of travelers.  They appear to be doing better than most in the town.  Yet, with the financial security availed by curious outsiders comes a necessary softening of one's pride.  The dive has now become a sideshow, performed for a crowd who will clap their hands then walk away once the body resurfaces from the river below.  The town, rich in culture and history, has become a quaint detour between the ocean and the city.
