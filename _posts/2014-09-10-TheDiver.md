The diver leans casually, his back to the abyss, on the railing atop Stari Most, or "Old Bridge" as its name translates.  Bronzed, lanky, confident, he gazes lazily over the tops of the heads of his audience, the only acknowledgment of their presence lies in his showmanship.  He lengthens his body, stretching his arms to their fullest extent in a straight line above his head, each rib in his wiry torso visible from a distance.  Fingers jab record buttons on cameras and mobile devices, anticipating a souvenir from their two hour detour en route from Dubrovnik to Sarajevo.  The young man's body drifts backward, the speed at which it falls toward the river below increasing until, without a moment to spare, he clutches the iron crossbar, bringing his free-fall to an abrupt halt.  He pauses for a few moments, rear end extended away from the structure, the two halves of his body forming an acute angle, then pulls himself back into his initial position.

The onlookers hesitate as they begin to retract their arms, hoping that this is all part of his pre-dive ritual.  After all, they stopped at the promise of a show; an Eastern European daredevil performing a stunt undoubtedly passed down to him by his father or his grandfather, or both.  Visions of home movie night with the couples from the neighborhood are quickly extinguished as the young man swings one leg and then the other over the railing and proceeds through the crowd and out of sight.  Dumbfounded, the crowd disperses, looking for a new souvenir; perhaps a pen made from an empty bullet casing or a magnet for the fridge.

The diver is not the daredevil the crowd wants him to be.  He is a gypsy as the unimpressed townspeople say; and he is poor. Jobs are at a premium in Mostar, and if anyone is going to be given one, it will not be a gypsy.  Mostar, with its abundance of Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian architecture, is bound to get the best and worst that tourism has to offer.  With tourism comes the prostitution of culture, yet in a country with a 44.6 percent unemployment rate, it is a necessary evil.
