<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125061170@N06/18620398783" title="Ha Long Bay by Kevin Bicknell, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3800/18620398783_820f469f22_z.jpg" width="640" height="415" alt="Ha Long Bay"></a>

The name might not immediately register upon hearing mention of Vietnam’s Ha Long Bay, but rare is the internet surfer who has never ridden the crest of a wanderlust wave set in the wake of a photo of the iconic oceanic inlet. Ha Long Bay is one of those places consistently featured in bucket list articles primed as clickbait for the recreational web user.  “20 Places to See Before You Die” “World’s Most Beautiful Destinations” etc. Unfortunately, “Best Kept Secrets” is not a list the UNESCO Natural Heritage Site has ever been assigned to, as is evidenced by the rat race of cruise ships peppering its expanses at all times.

Vietnam is unlike America in many ways. Traffic and food safety laws taken for granted within the confines of the latter are nearly non-existent in the former.  However, in terms of entrepreneurial vision, Ho Chi Minh and Uncle Sam gaze through lenses tinted to a strikingly similar shade of green. If Vietnam’s communist political leanings were not so heavily publicized, one would scoff at the mere suggestion that the Vietnamese business plan were transcribed in red ink. In major cities and other places that host droves of foreign visitors, everything is for sale and everyone a salesman. Many proclaim that now, during a period in which the country is experimenting with unbridled capitalism, is a fascinating time to visit. Conversely, an equal number profess that the solicitation a western face subjects itself to by stepping out its hotel door is a proletarian pain in the ass.  

A trip to Vietnam is a constant battle between frustration and reward, and anyone planning to spend some time there would be well informed to steer clear of the beaten path. Of course, places like Ha Long Bay wouldn’t be so flooded with outsiders if they weren’t something worth seeing, which poses somewhat of a conundrum.  I resigned to a barebones, 2-day-1-night cruise of the area, and while an unflattering smudge in my independent streak, such methods truly are the easiest way to see what all the fuss is about.  

The fuss, as fusses sometimes are, is much warranted. I made sure I had a couple rolls of film handy, and at points had to restrain myself lest I photograph every line of peaks poking up across the horizon like fingers emerging from a bath to check for pruning. Ha Long Bay is truly a spectacle; an artistic playground indiscriminate to medium, skill or experience. The ranks of islands gradually fading into the distant haze evoke images of ancient watercolor paintings plucked from their humid oriental origins and plopped on the wall of a meticulously climate controlled gallery. It is one of those sought after places where the subject’s astounding beauty has the ability to usurp technical proficiency.  

Accordingly, I was largely pleased with the fruits of my labor.
