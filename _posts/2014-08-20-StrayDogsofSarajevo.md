"Help control the pet population; have your pet spayed or neutered." Bob Barker's closing message to the audience of The Price is Right is one familiar to generations of Americans.  Apparently they don't watch The Price is Right in Sarajevo.

The abundance of stray dogs is the characteristic of the city that caught me most off guard in my first few days here.  The bullet holes and abandoned buildings were to be expected.  They were shocking in their own right, but not necessarily surprising.  This is not to say that nobody mentioned anything about stray dogs before my departure.  In fact, I received three rabies shots primarily due to the possibility of encounters with such creatures.  However, in all the warnings I was given, the matter of stray dogs was only mentioned in regard to the Asian leg of my trip.  Thus, I was blindsided my first morning here, when I was rolling around what I thought to be an empty skatepark, and happened upon a young German Shepherd curled beneath one of the ramps.  Startled, I kept my distance and left the park shortly thereafter.

In the following days, my encounters with strays became more frequent.  Alleyways, public parks, tourist sites, you name it; stray dogs can be found anywhere in the city.  The more I came across them however, I began to realize that my fear of these animals was wholly unnecessary.  Of course, a certain degree of caution should be exercised in any encounter with a stray animal.  Things like rabies do exist, and on a less severe note, things like fleas could be a nuisance to the bright eyed traveler.  However, with this said, it is necessary to understand that a stray dog in Sarajevo is treated as just another resident, albeit on four legs.  Most of the human population fails to even notice when a dog is laying nearby, and the dogs themselves seem rather indifferent to humans unless they offer some form of sustenance.

The dogs often travel in small cliques; a word I use in favor of the term, "pack", which likens them to the wolf, a creature with whom they share very little in terms of temperament and demeanor.  They lounge in the shade provided by parked cars or narrow streets during the day, and wander at night in search of scraps.  They stop and wait for the walk signal at crosswalks, and lap refreshment from the catch basins of public drinking fountains.  Occasionally you'll find one rummaging in a dumpster, but that happens with people too.

In many ways, the stray dogs of Sarajevo are a fitting metaphor for the city itself:  Occasionally rough around the edges, often misunderstood, feared by westerners, but in reality, irresistibly charming.
