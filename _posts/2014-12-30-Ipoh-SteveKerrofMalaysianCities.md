There is much to be said about those who find themselves in the rank of third place. First and second are rarely a surprise; the winner often the most accomplished, the runner up the fiercest competition. On a different day their positions could be reversed. Third place however, is almost always a wild card. On an Olympic podium, the athletes standing atop the one and two platforms are usually positioned in their expected places, while the least altitudinous spot represents a blip on an otherwise predictably clear radar. This place has occasionally been held by a favorite who had an uncharacteristic showing, but is more often occupied by the underdog who had their day. For the latter, that three inch tall platform is sky high, but to the rest of the world it is Kangchenjunga to Everest; an outstanding achievement to those in the know, but an accomplishment requiring explanation to the rest of the world.

In team sport, the same phenomenon presents itself. The third place club is the one that didn't make it to the big game. Years down the line when commentators revisit timeless moments in the sport's history, few will recall the division series champion or the victor of the consolation match. However, those with personal connections to the bronze medal winners - families, friends, the coach who was let go after his finest season - reserve a special place in their hearts for those ranked third. They may not be the best, or even next best, but they have a characteristic charm absent in those pampered by success.

The same can be said about third place when speaking of a country's most populous cities. The largest city, often the capital, is the Michael Jordan of the bunch; a household name if nothing else. Kuala Lumpur's Petronas Towers will be recognized by nearly anyone who is shown a picture, even if they can't place them on a map.The second city, the metaphorical Scottie Pippen, is just as widely known to much of the world, though without quite the degree of product endorsements. In most second cities one will still encounter a noticeable amount of foreign faces, though skyscrapers and Starbucks locations will be far less frequent. The second city's name appears on many travelers' itineraries, though it is rarely the most anticipated stop on the trip. George Town is a perfect illustration of this, with countless attractions geared toward visitors, but none of the iconic imagery of big brother KL. The third city, akin to the Steve Kerrs of the world, is a stopover point, a place to get lunch or spend a night, if not skipped altogether. However, for those who take the time to consider the statistics on Steve Kerr's trading card, they'll be pleasantly surprised with the numbers they find. Likewise, a country's third largest city, though lacking the attractions and photo opportunities of its more decorated brethren, always has its own value to the traveler who takes a closer look. For me, this was the case first with Nis, Serbia, and again with Malaysia's yellow ribbon city, Ipoh. 

There is no need to spend a great deal of time in the Ipoh. Two and a half days was plenty for me, though any less would not have been adequate. The city has its fair share of the colonial architecture and street art that draws many off the coast to George Town, and features numerous options for the culinary delights synonymous with Malaysia. All this, of course, is on a smaller scale than the country's two largest cities. Ipoh may not be the crowd favorite, or the most valuable player, but I suspect all who go there are as pleasantly surprised as I was, and see why the city belongs on the roster.
