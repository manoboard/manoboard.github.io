<p>Is skateboarding a universal language?</p>

<p>From August 12, 2014 to April 12, 2015, I traveled the world in search of an answer to this question, amongst other things.  Along the way, my skateboard served as a mode of transportation, a source of fun, and a way to make connections with people I might not have met otherwise.</p>  

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Kevin Bicknell and I am a recent graduate of the University of Washington’s Museology Graduate Program.  I am interested in understanding the ways in which museums can tell authentic stories about communities they may not have any experience with.  My interests focus specifically on communities that members adopt out of their own free will, as opposed to those into which they are born.  What determines their perceptions of what is cool and uncool? Innovative and repetitive? Authentic and inauthentic? I hope to find the stories within these communities that are universal; the ones that are intriguing regardless of one’s cultural associations.  In finding these stories and presenting them in an authentic, compelling manner, museums have the potential to foster greater understanding, and address issues of stereotyping and misrepresentation.</p>

<h1>About My Thesis</h1>

<p>As one of the major requirements for my MA in Museology, I produced a thesis titled, <em>Examining Perceptions of Authenticity in Museum Exhibits about Skateboarding</em>.  The study asked seven skateboarders to look at exhibit labels and photos of objects from four museum exhibits about skateboarding, and identify which tell an authentic story and which do not.  The study was designed to address the growing interest in skateboard culture within the museum field, the lack of literature specifically on that subject, and the disconnect between how skaters and non-skaters view skateboarding.  Through the data I was able to identify some interesting trends regarding which elements were deemed authentic and inauthentic, as well as how participants came to these conclusions. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/51dd3u5lq5t8x5v/Bicknell_Authenticity.pdf">Download the full document here.</a></p>
