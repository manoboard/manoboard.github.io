<h1>A Man, A Board, Abroad, A Blog</h1>
<p>Is skateboarding a universal language?</p>

<p>I think so, but I guess I’ll find out soon enough.  I’m a recent graduate of the University of Washington’s Museology Graduate Program and starting in August I’ll be traveling the world for 8 months on a Bonderman Fellowship.  Along the way, my skateboard will be a mode of transportation, a source of fun, and a way to make connections with people I might not meet otherwise.</p>  

<h1>About My Thesis</h1>

<p>As one of the major requirements for my MA in Museology, I am currently wrapping up my thesis titled, Examining Perceptions of Authenticity in Museum Exhibits about Skateboarding.  The study asked seven skateboarders to look at exhibit labels and photos of objects from four museum exhibits about skateboarding, and identify which tell and authentic story and which do not.  The study was designed to address the growing interest in skateboard culture within the museum field, the lack of literature specifically on that subject, and the disconnect between how skaters and non-skaters view skateboarding.  Through the data I was able to identify some interesting trends regarding which elements were deemed authentic and inauthentic, as well as how participants came to these conclusions. </p> 

<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>I’m going to try to keep things at least vaguely skateboarding related here, but in reality I doubt I have eight months worth of interesting things to say on the subject.  In that regard, I’ll try my best not to bore you with “the 5 must eat dishes of Skopje”, but instead provide a blend of skateboarding, culture, my thesis, museums, and interesting things I encounter in my travels.</p>
