      <h2><a href="/2014/06/26/detroit-sarajevo-and-my-thesis/">Detroit, Sarajevo, and My Thesis</a></h2>
      <span class="date">Posted on June 26, 2014</span>
      <p>A couple years ago a friend lent me Jeffrey Eugenides’s “The Marriage Plot”, a lengthy yet surprisingly quick read, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  For whatever reason, I never branched out into the rest of the author’s repertoire, and never learned much about the man himself.  However, a few weeks ago one of my old favorite sites, <a href="http://www.boat-mag.com/against-ruin-porn/">Atlas Obscura</a>, linked to an article from an issue of Boat Magazine written by Eugenides titled, “<a href="http://www.boat-mag.com/against-ruin-porn/">Against Ruin Porn</a>”.  </p>

<p>I found myself quickly engaged as the author spoke of his home city, the once thriving, now struggling, Detroit, MI.  He described teenage journeys into the deserted halls of the former metropolis, accompanied by six-packs of beer and a gaggle of friends.  He described memories that would immediately resonate with any male who has lived past age 16, regardless of where they call home.  His tales took no stretch of the imagination to identify with, and although I was unfamiliar with the term, “Ruin Porn”, I easily recognized the picture he was painting.</p>

<p>The term itself refers to the photos that flood the internet; ones of decrepit brownstones and abandoned factories, whose shattered windows and graffitied innards give undergrads with Polaroid Cameras the hope that someday they’ll be Magnum Photographers.  Yet, Eugenides does not shame ruin porn enthusiasts. In fact, he acknowledges that the same sort of macabre fascination that drew photographers from around the globe to his hometown was the same fascination that brought him and his friends out of their bedrooms in the middle of the night.  The issue, he states, is in the feeling that comes about whenever an outsider tells the rest of the world a story that you and your friends already know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Filmmakers and photographers from far afield, such as the French photographers Yves Marchand and Romain Meffre, descended on Detroit to make coffee table books, speaking all the while of the city’s destruction in abstract or poetic terms, and acting as though they were bringing us the news about ourselves. (Eugenides, 2014)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author’s quote describes perfectly a feeling that I suspect many people have encountered at some point in their lives.  For me, growing up in one of Massachusetts’s many rural suburbs – towns resembling those bordering urban centers despite their great distance from any city – the feeling Eugenides describes brings back memories of complaining about how boring and far removed from the rest of the world my hometown was.  However, the second these same accusations left the lips of a non-resident, I immediately became the town’s biggest supporter.  </p>

<p>Granted, to my knowledge nobody ever gained critical acclaim speaking poetically about the lack of activities available for teens in Groton, MA.  The issue that ties my experience to that of Eugenides and his friends, however, is one of authority.  Who has the credentials to point out a city or town’s less attractive side?  Moreover, is it acceptable for an outsider to tell this story at all?    </p>

<p>Perhaps I’m just looking to equate my own work with that of a Pulitzer Prize winner, or perhaps with school still fresh in my mind my thoughts all lead to the same place, but I could not help but find Eugenides’s article particularly relevant to museums, and more specifically, to my thesis.</p>

<p>Just hear me out.</p>

<p>One of the most compelling findings of my study, which examined skateboarders’ perceptions of authenticity in regard to museum exhibits about their own culture, was a negative response to the use of stereotypical skateboarding-related slang:  words like “dude” and “sick”.  Participants regularly used the same terminology themselves during the interview process, but commented that exhibit copy employing such slang felt forced.</p>

<p>As I read “Against Ruin Porn”, I began to draw the connection to this finding, seeing Eugenides’s experience as a near parallel to that of a skateboarder rolling their eyes at an outsider’s adoption of their vernacular.  Yet the problem is not only in the frustration one feels when someone else tells their story, but rather what the implications are for those who remain when the exhibit closes or the coffee table books sell out.  For the skateboarders, the result is a continued misrepresentation of who they are.  Though this is an inconvenient and often costly misunderstanding, the outside world is hardly lining up skateboarders and sending them off to the gas chambers. However, on a larger scale such perpetuation of misinformation, despite containing minor truths, can be much more detrimental.  </p>

<p>As Eugenides mentions, in the case of Detroit this means the 500,000 residents whose city is rarely mentioned outside of discussions of crime and poverty.  The longer the rest of the world views the city solely in this light, the longer it will take for Detroit to revitalize itself.</p>

<p>In light of my upcoming travels, Eugenides’s article is especially poignant. Though the most recent Balkan war technically ended 20 years ago, most collective memory of the region remains closely tied to images of death and destruction.  Twenty years after the fact, a Google search for “Sarajevo” brings up countless scenes of crumbling buildings and graffiti-covered concrete.  Like the photographers who descended upon Detroit, those traveling to the Balkans often do so to speak about the decay in poetic terms, or else lament on the beauty and simplicity of this distant, exotic region and its people. </p>

<p>As Eugenides notes, there is an undeniable fascination with such ruin.  It is unlikely one would find bombed out buildings and unexploded landmines in any American city, and thus these things entice all who were not subject to the cruelty that birthed them.  There is no denying that reminders of the war are ever present in Balkan countries; just as abandoned buildings exist in Detroit.  The same goes for stereotypical skateboard slang.  Words like “dude” and “sick” are used liberally in everyday conversation amongst skateboarders.  However, the problem arises when these things come to embody people or places in the eyes of the rest of the world.</p>

<p>I’m compelled to think that the people of Sarajevo see much more in their city than the leftovers from the war, and as a guest in their hometown, I hope to see more than that as well.  Admittedly, I am guilty of clicking through albums of ruin porn, but as I venture into each country throughout my journey, I will make a conscious effort to put this fascination aside, and in the pictures I post and the stories I write, I hope to show the cities as they are today, not as they fit into the mold the internet has carved out for them.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2014/06/01/well-how-did-i-get-here/">Well, How Did I Get Here?</a></h2>
      <span class="date">Posted on June 01, 2014</span>
      <p><img src="/images/kevin-dresden.jpg" alt="In Dresden"></p>

<p>In the spring of 2012, I traveled with my friend, Mark, to Dresden, Germany, the first city on a three-week trip around central Europe.  We opted for a multi-stop, morning-to-morning flight to save money, a decision we were already regretting as we started flying west from Boston, rather than over the Atlantic toward Germany.  It was about 7am local time when finally we reached our destination.  Neither of us had slept much on the plane, and the last traces of excitement that had kept us awake were rapidly fading, leaving us dead on our feet, in search of plush bedding and heavy rest. Unfortunately, German hotels, like those in America, generally do not allow guests to check in at such an early hour.  Exhausted, anxious, and altogether unprepared to handle the difficulties that come with foreign travel, we left our bags at the front desk, took our skateboards, and headed around the corner to a skatepark that we had spotted while trying to find the hotel.  Stepping foot on my skateboard added a welcome note of comfort to an otherwise stressful morning.  I was finally starting to relax when another skateboarder said something to me in what I presumed to be German.  A deer in front of headlights, my mind raced to think of the one phrase I had tried to memorize on the plane.  Stuttering, and looking to Mark for support, I spoke.</p>

<p>“Ick…spreckin…nickt…doysh.”</p>

<p>Though I am certain my botched attempt at, “I don’t speak German”, did not explicitly say so, the message was crystal clear.</p>

<p>“Oh, English?” he asked, rather fluently.</p>

<p>Flush with embarrassment, my heart rate returned to normal as we struck up a conversation about the one thing we knew we had in common: skateboarding. Mark and I were quickly enlightened to the whereabouts of other parks in the area, and learned all about a man called “Concrete Rudolph”, known for building subpar concrete skateparks around the continent.  Though I am sure a soft bed and a good night’s sleep would have done similar wonders for my outlook, this simple interaction made me feel a mild sense of confidence in a place that had been intimidating up to that point.  Of all the wonderful memories of that trip, this remains one of my fondest.</p>

<p>The preceding anecdote introduced the proposal I submitted for the Bonderman Travel Fellowship, an award presented each year to 14 University of Washington students.  The fellowship allows recipients to travel alone around the world for at least 8 months, visiting at least 6 countries and two distinct regions.  My application proposed that skateboarding is an easy way to meet people anywhere in the world and, as I experienced in Dresden, can make a strange new place feel a little more like home.</p>

<p>Apparently I made a convincing argument, and here I am roughly two months away from my departure to Sarajevo, where I will begin my journey. From August to April, I’ll travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China, and maybe an additional country or two somewhere in between. Along the way I’ll ride my skateboard, and hopefully meet some other people who like to do the same.  I’m not quite sure what to expect aside from the occasional rolled ankle, but I expect that the amount of fun I have will far outweigh any hardships I encounter.  I look forward to the journey ahead.</p>
